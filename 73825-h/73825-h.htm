<p>It was with no desire to compete with scientific botanies that this
collection of flowers was gathered together, but with the hope of
making their acquaintance more easy to non-scientific folk than the
much condensed manuals of our flora are able to do. The opportunity
of introducing a plant, with that graceful amplitude which forestalls
human meetings, is denied to the scientific botanist by the needful
restrictions of his formulæ, and there remain unnoted by him (because
beyond the scope of a special terminology) numberless traits of race-habit,
and personal details of growth belonging to the plants, to which
the unlearned observer will attach a degree of significance, incommensurate,
perhaps, to their scientific value. To the simple Nature-lover
each growth possesses a personal quality more desirable than the catalogued
facts of its existence, and which offers an invitation to his
thought beyond the knowledge he may gain from books.</p>

<p>Supplementary, then, to the scientific classification, there is a place
for the mere lover and observer, who shall display the results of his
study in the most direct terms, that require no glossaries of explanation,
nor, if it may be avoided, any dissection of flower-growths. Too often
the amateur is dismayed, in his effort to name a plant, by the botanical
need of a microscopic analysis, which calls for a preliminary training,
and in its process destroys the flower he seeks to know. If it were
possible for a pictorial botany to be prepared for English readers in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">(vi)</span>
common vocabulary, the destructive element which, at present, occupies
a painfully large place in the study of all popular science, might be
confined to the needs of the higher student, and no longer pursued by
children, or the merely curious observers of our common forms of life.
The effort to verify what has already been established, which, in some
intellectually alert localities, threatens the more delicate of our annuals
and biennials with extermination, might be avoided, if we were able to
recognize the commoner sorts of plants by their general character, their
gesture, color, and habits, leaving scientific analysis for serious study.</p>

<p>The present collection of flowers common to the North-eastern
United States, which was started as a personal pastime, has taken its
present shape under the belief that it were well to make a beginning
towards a floral portrait-gallery; it is from this point of view, rather
than from the purely botanical, that the drawings have been made and
the descriptions written. Days have been pleasantly spent in searching
for a specimen which would show most typically the particular trick of
growth, the characteristic gesture which individualized it from all other
plants; often a flower has been drawn and described as it grew, surprised
in its familiar haunt. Effort has been made to gather within
the prescribed limits as great a diversity of growths, and as many
variations of types in each family, as was feasible. Because of the
desire to localize the collection, somewhat, the flowers of the <span class="cor" title="Source: sea-board" id="corvi">seaboard</span>
have been excluded. A few shrubs, and even one small tree, the
Witch Hazel, have been included, because their flowers or fruit form
such essential features in the floral calendar, or possess so strong a hold
upon the wayfarers’ affections, that their presence has seemed inevitable.
In the case of two vines, the Carrion Flower and the Virginia Creeper,
the drawings were made from the fruit (companioned by the figure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">(vii)</span>
the single flower) for the obvious reason that the blossoms of the one
are inconspicuous, and of the other so malodorous, they offer small
temptations to a near acquaintance, while both are recompensed with
highly decorative berry-clusters. The drawings of the flowers are the
size of life; in every possible instance the growth also is given without
reduction.</p>

<p>That every flower-lover will find some favorites omitted, is altogether
probable, in a selection of three hundred individuals from among
the hosts which invite representation. The extreme dry weather of
the previous season must be held accountable for several noteworthy,
and much regretted, blanks in the list.</p>

<p>The choice of botanical terms has been intentionally confined to
those which long usage has so wrought into the common speech that
they have practically ceased to belong to strictly scientific nomenclature.
The floral families have been arranged in the order employed
in Gray’s <cite>Manual</cite>; the individual members of a genus, and of a family,
have been placed in their usual sequence of bloom, that the flower-gatherer
may know when to reasonably expect the successive blossoming
of any special set of plants. It is impossible however to be
arbitrarily definite in any such classification of Nature’s methods. Nor
are we able to do more than to approximate accuracy in describing
color; modifications, even direct contradictions, of the normal or usual
type are constantly discovered, which we may impute to variations in
soil or temperature, but whose appearance follows laws we dimly
apprehend. Of one thing only may we be sure: Nature tunes her
seemingly fickle choice to harmony, whatever the key; always there
remains a perfect adjustment of color between stalk and stem and leaf
and blossom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">(viii)</span></p>

<p>By the generosity of Mrs. Fanny D. Bergen, of Cambridge, Mass.,
the lists of folk-names for many flowers have been greatly enriched.
Recognition is due also to Dr. B. F. Robinson, and to his assistants of
the Harvard Herbarium, for very kind aid in the botanical classification
of specimens.</p>

<p>Found in April and May, on hillsides, along the edge of woods,
and in rocky ground.</p>

<p>The leaf-stems and flower-stems rise from the ground to the height
of 4 or 6 inches.</p>

<p>The leaf is heart-shaped, and 3-lobed, of a tough, strong fibre that
often survives the winter. Its color is dark green above and dull
violet beneath.</p>

<p>The beautiful flower is composed of 6 to 9 petal-like calyx-parts,
of an oval shape, and thin texture, whose color varies from light to
dark violet, and from lavender-tinted white to a very pink-lavender, or
lilac; the stamens are many, and thread-like, and of a pale straw color.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">(2)</span>
Close beneath the flower are 3 reddish-brown, downy little leaves,
bearing the semblance of a calyx. The flower is set on a slender, very
downy stem, which springs from amidst the leaves.</p>

<p>The harmony of color in this plant as seen in the flower and leaf
is striking, a preponderance of violet showing throughout. It is very
downy, the young leaves being covered with long silky hairs. The
numerous half-opened flowers and buds are slightly nodding, but
become more erect when fully spread in the sunlight. The Hepatica is
often frequented by small lavender butterflies, in size and color resembling
the blossoms,—when they rise and flutter in the soft spring
air, it is as though the flowers themselves are taking flight.</p>

<p>Found in late April and early May, in swamps or wet meadows,
with its roots in the water.</p>

<p>The branching stalk, from 6 to 10 inches in height, is thick, stout,
hollow and juicy, and grooved at the joints; its color is a shining light
green.</p>

<p>The leaf is very broad, almost round, with a heart-shaped base, the
margin finely cut in slight scallops; the texture is thin but leathery,
while the surface is smooth and glossy; the color is dark green. The
leaf is set at the junction of the flower-stem with the stalk.</p>

<p>The flower has 5 (or more) rounded petal-like calyx-parts, of a
delicate texture that shows a few veins on the inside; it is shaped like
a shallow cup and colored a beautiful polished yellow, tinged with
green; the many stamens are yellow; the pistils form a conspicuous
fringy center. Two or three flowers, on simple, or sometimes leafy
foot-stems, form a terminal group.</p>

<p>The buds are round and quite green, turning yellow as they grow;
the blossom opens very wide, and is slightly odorous,—it is in marked
contrast to the coarser stem and leaf, which have a sprangly gesture.
The first sunshine flower of spring.</p>

<p>Found in thickets that yet are open to the sun, in early May or
perhaps late in April.</p>

<p>The single stem, about 6 inches in height, is round and smooth
and green, showing purple at the foot. It bears a whorl of leaves
about midway its height, and a single flower upon its summit.</p>

<p>The compound leaf has from 8 to 9 wedge-shaped leaflets, that
are sightly creased on their midribs, and irregularly notched on the
edges; the texture is delicately thin, and the color a lovely green.
Three leaves on their short reddish stems are placed in a whorl.</p>

<p>The flower is like a shallow cup formed of 5 oval, petal-like
calyx-parts that curve like shells; it is of a very thin texture and
slightly veined, and its color is pure white, often rosy tinted on the
outside; the many dainty stamens are a pale straw color, and the
pistils are gathered into a light green center.</p>

<p>A more charming plant could hardly be imagined,—stem, leaf,
and blossom are alike perfect in growth and harmony of hue. Its bud
nods, but the fully open flower lifts itself lightly atop the slender
swaying stem. The Wind Flower is social in habit, and gathers in
lovely fellowship with its kind upon a favorable hillside.</p>

<p>Found during July and August in meadows, roadsides, and woods.</p>

<p>The single stalk usually forks midway for the flowers; it grows
between 2 and 3 feet high, and is slender and slightly rough to the
touch. In color it is light green.</p>

<p>The compound leaf is 3-divided, the middle leaflet being 3-parted,
and the side leaflets 2-parted; the margins are notched, and the fibre is
tough, while the surface is rough-hairy; the color is green. The leaves
grow in a whorl of 3 about the stalk.</p>

<p>The flower is a shallow cup, composed of 5 petal-like calyx-parts,
hollowed like shells, of a greenish-white color; the pistils are many,
rising in a cylindrical greenish head in the center; the stamens are
numerous, and pale. The flowers are set on long slender stems which
rise from the whorl of leaves; these stems often fork again at half
their length, where in that case, they bear a pair of small leaves, from
which the 2, or more, secondary flower-bearing stems arise.</p>

<p>Less gregarious than its early sister, the Tall Anemone grows
solitary, or in twos and threes,—frequently beside an old stump. The
cylindrical or elongated head turns brown and becomes cottony when
the seeds are ripe. The tall elegance of this plant is noteworthy; it
bears its leaves, flowers and seeds with an air of distinction, and the
long wand-like stems suggest the strings of some musical instrument
on which the wind may play, according to the old tradition that the
Anemones love to bloom when the wind blows.</p>

<p>Found in rocky woods and hillsides during April and May.</p>

<p>The branching leafy stalk grows from 1 to 2 feet high; smooth,
round, and fine of fibre though strong; in color, green.</p>

<p>The leaf is 3 or 4 times divided, terminating in groups of 3 leaflets
on short slender stems; the leaflets are small, rounding, slightly heart-shaped
at the base, and their margins are notched in rounded scallops;
the texture is exceptionally fine and thin, the surface smooth; the color,
a fine cool green.</p>

<p>The flower is small and composed of 3 or 4 or 5 little, petal-like,
pale green calyx-parts. Different plants bear the pistils and stamens;
the flowers of the former are inconspicuous and sparse in comparison
with those of the stamen-bearing plant: from these the many stamens,
pale green faintly touched with tawny at the tips, droop on slender
threads like little tassels. The flowers grow in loose clusters, on
branching stems that spring from the leaf-joints.</p>

<p>The Early Meadow Rue is unobtrusive in color and form, but most
graceful in gesture, and fine in the texture and finish of all its parts;
the leafage has a fern-like delicacy, and the flower tassels of the
stamen-bearing plant are airily poised.</p>

<p>Found in June in wet meadows, both in the shade of thickets and
in unsheltered fields.</p>

<p>The stalk, usually 3 or 4 feet high, attains, it is said, to even 9 feet
sometimes; it is branching, and somewhat zigzag in growth; round,
slightly ribbed, and smooth; green or purple, especially near the joints.</p>

<p>The leaf is highly compound, being composed of 3 long-stemmed
divisions which are parted into 3 or 5 short-stemmed groups of 3 leaflets
each; these leaflets are rounding in shape, entire,—save for the 1 to 3
round scallops at the tips,—of a fine and thin texture, and smooth surface;
a network of delicate veins shows underneath; the color is a
beautiful, cool, dark green, lighter underneath. The arrangement is
alternate.</p>

<p>The flower is without petals; the numerous thread-like, white
stamens, with their green tips, spread into feathery tufts, and are set
on tiny stems in loose terminal clusters, and also in lesser groups on
stems from the angles of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>An elegant plant, beautiful at all seasons with its distinguished-bearing,
charming flower clusters, and quaint lavender-hued seed-heads;
and especially attractive at the turn of the leaf, when its foliage takes
on a delicate crimson tint toned by a grayish bloom.</p>

<p>Found in woods and on shady banks, in May.</p>

<p>The slender, erect stalk, 5 or 6 inches in height, is fine and smooth;
in color, a light reddish-tinged green.</p>

<p>The leaf is compound, each part being set on a slender, rather long
stem; the leaflets are small, broad, heart-shaped at the base, and 2- or
3-lobed near the tip; the texture is exceedingly fine, and smooth to
the touch; the color is a dark grayish-green. The leaves form a whorl
about the summit of the stalk, from which the flower-stems rise.</p>

<p>The flower is formed of 5 to 8 petal-like calyx-parts, which are
oval, slightly convex, of a fine and delicate texture; in color, white,
tinged with pale pink. The stamens are many, small, and orange
yellow; the several pistils gathered in the center are green. The
flowers are poised on slender stems, in groups, generally of 3,
springing from the leaf-whorl.</p>

<p>The flowers and leaves rise from the earth together, the undeveloped
flower, with bowed head, enfolded by the leaflets; as the plant
pushes upward the blossoms grow, the central one developing first, the
side ones later. At first the stamens and pistils are gathered together
in a close green ball in the middle,—when the central flower has
shaken out its yellow-tipped stamens fully, the side flowers begin to
grow; thus the plant stays in bloom a long time—nearly two weeks.</p>

<p>Found in the woods during May.</p>

<p>The small round smooth stalk branches near the top, and grows
about 2 feet high. It is green, with a cool gray-white bloom.</p>

<p>The leaf is rather large, and compound, being 2 or 3 times
divided; the leaflets are oval, taper-pointed, and set on long, grooved,
shining foot-stems; the margin is prettily toothed, with an occasional
deep notch, the ribs and veins show like a fine network, the texture is
loose, with a noticeable softness to the touch, the surface is shining;
the color green. The leaf is set immediately upon the stalk.</p>

<p>The flower is very small; 4 to 10 white petals with oval tips and
very slender bases; the many delicate, white stamens, with yellow tips,
are longer than the petals. The flowers are arranged in a large, loose,
round or club-shaped spike, on a long smooth stem, that springs from
the junction of the leaf.</p>

<p>The calyx drops as the flowers open, and the petals soon fall also,
leaving the stamens, which remain some time; these are succeeded by
the ripening berries that are to be seen frequently during August in
deep woods; they are oval in shape and of a shining coral red. The
plant seldom bears more than a single spike of flowers.</p>

<p>The White Baneberry, <i lang="la">A. alba</i>, is very like the Red, but its berries
(called “Dolls’ Eyes” in Massachusetts) are shining white with a black
dot, and their foot-stems are noticeably larger.</p>

<p>Found growing in the clefts of rocks, on sunlit heights, and along
banks, during May or June.</p>

<p>The height of the stalk varies from 6 to 18 inches, and it branches
widely; it is small, slightly enlarged at the joints, and somewhat
square in shape, sometimes rough to the touch; the color is green,
strongly tinged with purple-red.</p>

<p>The lower leaves are compound, with 3 leaflets, their margins
round-toothed; the upper leaves are oval, or sometimes divided, their
margins frequently entire; the texture is very thin and fine; the color
light green. They are set on long, slender stems, or at the junction of
the branches.</p>

<p>The flower varies a good deal in size; it consists of 5 tubular
petals that are prolonged into slender spurs with rounded tips; the
calyx is 5-parted, the divisions of a long oval shape, which curve
closely between the spurs, alternating with the tubes. The color of
the tubes is a pure and lovely yellow, which becomes, by a beautiful
gradation, a deep red in the spurs, their tips even tending toward
crimson; the calyx is orange-red, running to yellow-green at the stem;
the many long stamens hanging in a central tassel are very yellow.
The flower nods on the end of a curved stem, with its spurs uppermost.</p>

<p>In early spring the plant consists of a thick tuft of leaves. While
still very small the bud begins to turn from pale green to reddish. In
maturity the seed-pods become erect. The singular elegance of this
plant is only too well appreciated, for human greed plucks it in
reckless handfuls, without regard to its possible extinction.</p>

stems, the upper clasp the stalk with a pale, silvery and hairy sheath.</p>

<p>The flower cup is formed of 5 broad petals with pointed bases; its
inner surface is very shining, the outer is dull; the color is a pure full
yellow. The numerous stamens are also yellow, and the many pistils
are bunched in a green center. The calyx is 5-parted, the divisions
being narrow and pointed, and spreading very wide; it is a pale yellow-green.
The flowers are set on long slender stems.</p>

<p>Though the wealth of bloom occurs in June when the meadow-grasses
tassel, the burnished golden cups stray through all the season
till frost-time. The bud is very round and small, and the flower grows
perceptibly after it has opened.</p>

<p>Found in moist ground, in June and July.</p>

<p>The stalk (about 2 feet high) is very leafy, stout, round, and hollow,
of a coarse fibre, and exceedingly hairy; light green.</p>

<p>The large compound leaf is divided into 3 parts (they are set
on hairy stems) that are divided twice again; the parts are sharp-pointed
and deeply notched, with the ribs and veins showing plainly,
of a coarse, loose texture, and very hairy both above and beneath. The
arrangement is alternate, and clasping. The color is light yellowish-green.</p>

<p>The flower is small: a few little round yellow petals and a fringe
of yellow stamens surround the base of the long thimble-shaped green
head formed by the pistils. The flowers are set on hairy stems in loose
leafy groups.</p>

<p>The admirable curve of the stalk is forgotten in the stinging sensation
its prickly hairs produce upon the touch; it is very like plucking
a nettle to try to gather this Crowfoot, though the effect is comparatively
transient.</p>

<p>Found festooning rocks and walls on uplands and mountains in
early May.</p>

<p>This handsome vine is sparingly leafy, somewhat branching, and
not perfectly round; it is woody-fibred and breaks easily, smooth to the
touch, and slightly shining; the color is a light brown of a golden hue.</p>

<p>The leaf is 3-parted, each leaflet upon a slender foot-stem; the
leaflets are oval or wedge-shaped, the margin either irregularly cut, or
deeply notched, or nearly entire; the many ribs and netted veins show;
the texture is somewhat thin, and the surface is sparingly covered—particularly
on the underside—by soft hairs. The color is light green,
frequently running into red- or purple-bronze hues, especially when
young. The leaves are set on long purplish or reddish stems, and arranged
in pairs, at a considerable distance apart, along the lithe curving
stalk.</p>

<p>The flower is large; its 4 calyx-parts look like petals: they are
long oval, with pointed tips, of a particularly thin, loose texture, and
have a very downy surface both inside and out; the many veins show
distinctly; the color is a light purple of a broken tint, sometimes nearly
white on the inner side. The stamens are many and crowded into a
close central tuft, the outer row of them shaped like slender oblong petals;
in color, green-white with light green-yellow tips. The single blossom
is set on a slender green stem which springs from between the leaves.</p>

<p>The flower seldom spreads wide, its seeming petals curve inward
in a deep cup-shape. A noticeable feature is the presence of the brown
and dry leaf-stems of the last year’s growth standing out at right angles
to the fresh leafage. This is one of the rarer plants, and therefore
should be left where it grows, with free curves clinging to the rocks or
swinging its violet-tinged greenery and purple bells from the stronger
growth of a neighboring shrub.</p>

<p>Found through July and August climbing over wayside thickets
and along river banks.</p>

<p>The stalk of this charming vine is leafy, round, tough-fibred, and
grooved, and rather slender. It is green in color, tinged more or less
with dull bronzy purple.</p>

<p>The large leaf is compound of 3 leaflets, that are oval with a long,
tapering point, and a slightly heart-shaped base; the margin is cut into
a few large notches, and occasionally is lobed; the ribs are strong, the
texture firm, and the surface is smooth. Each leaflet is set on a short
curved stem; the leaves, on their long stems, are placed opposite each
other. In color they are dark green.</p>

<p>The flowers are of two kinds, the pistil-bearing blossoms and the
stamen-bearing occur on separate plants. The flower of both plants
has 4 petal-like calyx-parts, of oblong shape with rounded tips; the
color is greenish white; the stamens and pistils are pale green. The
flowers grow on short light green stems, in branching clusters from the
angles of the leaves and the end of the vine.</p>

<p>The Clematis climbs by means of its leaf-stems, which grow in strong
deep curves; it sometimes hooks them over a support, and again clasps
them more securely by twisting the stem once or twice around. It is
what Ruskin calls a “gadding vine,” for it runs riot over stone wall
and hedge, stretching out a social hand to every wayside shrub, and
swinging its flowery festoons from dry twig to leafy sapling. The
green of the leafage is agreeably varied by the purple-bronzy leaves of
the new growths; and the silvery feathery seeds, following the pistil-bearing
blossoms in September and October, are quite as beautiful as
the flower, and have a faint, delightful fragrance of their own.</p>

<p>Found on hilly pastures, in roadside thickets, during May and June.</p>

<p>A shrub, which grows from 3 to 5 or more feet in height, and
branches thickly; it is armed with many needle-like spines, and the
bark is gray.</p>

<p>The leaf is a small oval with a rounded tip, its edge beset with
many short sharp spines; its fibre is tough, and surface very smooth,
and the color is a light bluish-green. The arrangement is in rosette-like
groups of 5 or more leaves.</p>

<p>The small flower has 6 rounding, concave, yellow petals, a 6-parted
calyx, and 6 stamens which curve outward from the circular green
pistil and rest their tips in the hollows of the petals. The flowers
grow in drooping clusters, hanging from the leafy rosettes all along
the ends of the branches with a graceful gesture.</p>

<p>The fruit, ripe in September and October, is an oval red berry,
sour and puckering to the taste. The wood is a strong yellow color,
and the roots gleam in the freshly turned soil like pieces of gold in the
dark earth. In some parts of the country the berries are made into a
preserve, and the wood is used for dyeing.</p>

<p>Found in woodlands during May and June.</p>

<p>The single stalk, 14 to 18 inches in height, bears upon its summit
a pair of great leaves on forking stems; it is large, round, very hard
and fibrous, juicy, smooth, and somewhat glossy; a dry, tough, pale
sheath enwraps it at the foot. In color it is a very light green, almost
white.</p>

<p>The leaves are almost a foot across and nearly circular in shape,
divided into 5 or 9 wedge-shaped radiating parts which are often 2- (or
more) lobed, and with as many main ribs as there are divisions; all the
lesser ribs and veins are conspicuous in these highly ornamental leaves—they
have shallow but sharp-pointed margins, and are rather thin in
texture, smooth and glossy, and of a rich dark green color, whitened
with bloom underneath. The stems are large and pale.</p>

<p>The flower is formed of several wedge-shaped petals (6 to 9), firm
and thick of texture, showing many fine-netted veins, and dull white in
color; they spread and curve about the base of the prominent greenish
seed-box, the large and conspicuous stamens forming a ring in the
center. The flower, on a pale stem, grows from between the leaf-stems
with a distinct inclination to one side.</p>

<p>In bud the flower is enfolded by 3 temporary bracts,—the 6 calyx-parts
also fall when the petals expand. The long rather oval fruit is
found eatable by the uncritical palates of children.</p>

<p>Found in still and shallow water from June to September.</p>

<p>The leaves and flowers, on their long, smooth stems, rise to the
surface of the water from the submerged root.</p>

<p>The leaf is large (from 6 to 12 inches in length), of a long oval
shape, heart-shaped at the base, and blunt-pointed at the tip, with an
entire margin; its fibre is tough and leathery, and its surface exceedingly
smooth and shining. Its color is a strong light green, lighter
underneath. The stem is large and half-cylindrical; the leaf floats on
the water, or rises above it.</p>

<p>The large flower is almost spherical in form, with 6 large, rounded,
concave, petal-like parts, somewhat unequal in size; the 3 smaller parts
are green without, and a dull reddish-orange color within; the other 3
larger parts are yellow, with small green patches at the base. The
large pistil is marked on the top with a 12- or 24-pointed star, the rays
of which are yellow on an orange-red ground. The stamens are many,
like loops of yellow ribbon which curl back and almost entirely fill
the hollow flower-cup. The stem is large, round, and green, and the
flower rises above the level of the water.</p>

<p>A flower of primitive type; the combination of yellow and red in
the star design of the pistil is suggestive of Egyptian color and design.
The half-round leaf-stem with its flat grooved side is an unusual
variation on the common form.</p>

<p>Found in still, clear water in July.</p>

<p>The flowers and leaves rise to the water’s level from the submerged
root.</p>

<p>The large leaf (4 or more inches long) is nearly round,—swinging
out from the true circle at its heart-shaped base into two little points;
its margin is entire; the ribs scarcely show on the upper side, radiating
in faint lines from a heart-shaped figure outlined on the base of the
leaf, but they are strongly marked on the under side; the surface is
smooth and shining, and the texture is fine and firm. The color is a
dark strong green above, and a fine coppery-red beneath. The leaf
floats flat upon the surface of the water, anchored to the root by a long,
elastic, round, red stem.</p>

<p>The many petals of the large flower are long, narrow, pointed, and
hollowed like a shallow canoe; of a close, firm texture, and usually a
pure brilliant white color. The numerous stamens are a pure cadmium-yellow.
The 4 calyx-parts are shaped like the petals, dull green on
the outside, and often tinged with pink on the edges and inside. The
flower on the top of its long red stem floats on the water.</p>

<p>The fragrant Water Nymph is said to open at sunrise, closing about
ten o’clock in the morning, and remaining shut during the heat of the
day to open again later. The contrast of its brilliant white with the
heart of gold is beautiful, with a charm which is partly lost when
plucked,—it is seen to its best advantage floating in the midst of its
green pads. The decorative design on the leaf is faintly marked and
can only be discovered by close inspection; the color of its lower
surface is <span class="cor" title="Source: fine" id="cor38">fine.</span> Sometimes the petals are pink-tinted.</p>

<p>Found in swamps in early June.</p>

<p>The leaves and flower-stems grow directly from the root.</p>

<p>The curious leaf is in the form of a deep cup or pitcher, with a
broad wing on one side, and a flaring top which answers to the lip of
the pitcher; the outer surface is smooth while the inner surface is set
with many short, downward-pointing bristles; the texture, especially of
the old pitchers, is tough and leathery, and the color is a strong green
more or less veined with dark red. A number of leaf-cups grow in a
cluster close to the ground.</p>

<p>The large flower has 5 long dull red petals rounded at the ends,
and folded over the large umbrella-like top of the pistil; beneath this
spreading green top is the large seed-case encircled by the many yellow
stamens; the 5 spreading parts of the calyx are thick and leathery, of
a dull reddish-brown on the outside, and green on the inside, with the
brown striking through in places. A single nodding flower grows on
the top of a long, smooth, light green stem.</p>

<p>The pitchers are often found half filled with water, and sometimes
contain the remains of small insects upon which the plant is said to
feed. There is no apparent resemblance to a “side-saddle” in the
flower unless it lies in the leathery texture of its parts. It might
fittingly be called “the Russia-leather flower.”</p>

<p>The leaf and flower rise from the root on short stems, from 3 to 6
inches high.</p>

<p>The large leaf (from 4 to 6 inches wide when fully grown) is
rounding in shape, with a heart-shaped base, and irregularly cut into
5 or 7 lobes; the ribs are strong, the texture is close and fine—rather
thick,—and the surface is smooth. The color is a cool green, silvery
underneath, the short stem and the ribs being reddish. The single leaf
grows from the root on a thick juicy stem.</p>

<p>The flower petals, usually 8, but sometimes 12 in number, spread
in a square shape; they are long, narrow, and tapering at both ends (4
being slightly broader than the other 4), fine in texture, and of a
brilliant white; the stamens are many, orange-yellow or golden, and
the single large pale yellow pistil is grooved through the middle; the
2-parted pale greenish calyx falls as the blossom expands. The flower-stem
is smooth, round, large, and pale green tinged with red.</p>

<p>The Bloodroot makes a wise provision against the inclement
season in which it blooms, and comes up from the ground wrapped
closely in its circular leaf-cloak, pushing its bud through the top to
open in the sunlight. The leaf slowly unrolls itself and stands, large
and broad, close to the ground,—in general effect it is suggestive of a
grape leaf. The root is charged with a dark orange-red acrid juice
which gives the plant its folk-name. To this plentiful rich color, no
doubt, the brilliant quality of the white blossom is due.</p>

<p>Found in flower, on the edge of thickets, in May.</p>

<p>A single stalk grows to the height of 6 or 7 inches; it is smooth,
round, and juicy; light green.</p>

<p>The compound leaf is very deeply 3 times cut into long, narrow
parts, with sharply notched edges; the texture is common (not to say
coarse), and the color a full juicy green. Two or three leaves, on short
foot-stems, grow in a whorl-like cluster about the stalk, a little below
the flower-cluster.</p>

<p>The flower has 4 rounded petals spreading at the top; in texture
rather thick, in color white, faintly tinged with violet; the 4-parted
calyx is pale green, and the 6 stamens, 2 noticeably shorter than the
others, are a dull greenish-yellow.</p>

<p>With the true vigor of its family this plant grows in small communities.
It stays in bud a long time before the blossoms finally open.
A number of small tubers are strung together on the roots, like beads
on a necklace; pungent and peppery to the taste.</p>

<p>Found in sunny places, by clear water and in moist meadows
during May.</p>

<p>The single stalk, from 12 to 16 inches in height, is branching only
for the flowers; it is large, fibrous, and strong, grooved, but very
smooth, and of a shining, pure, green color.</p>

<p>The lower leaves are 3 or 4 inches long, lyre-shaped, and cut nearly
to the midrib into 5 or 7 irregular lobes, the middle lobe being very
round; the upper leaves are cut less deeply, and are small; the margins
are entire, the texture strong, and the lower surface rough, the upper
being smooth and shining; in color, dark full green. The lowest
leaves are on clasping stems, all the rest clasp the stalk with a pair of
wings, alternately.</p>

<p>The 4 petals of the small flower are rounding, and arranged in
pairs within the small 4-parted green calyx; they are of a charming
light yellow color, and so are the 6 stamens. These stamens group
themselves oddly about the central pistil,—two pairs stand in front of
the pairs of petals, and the single shorter stamens fill the more open
spaces left in the opposite angles. The flowers form loose terminal
groups.</p>

<p>The stalk springs from a foot-rosette of the rich green leaves, and
is one of the earliest risers of the spring, in its chosen home—a marshy
meadow.</p>

<p>Found in grain fields, and along cultivated lands, from July to
September.</p>

<p>The large and branching stalk is zigzag or curved in habit of
growth, about 2 or 3 feet high, and ribbed; with occasional hairs; it is
bright green in color.</p>

<p>The lower leaves are lyre-shaped and large, the middle lobe wide
and curving to a long pointed tip, the side lobes being narrow; the
upper leaves are irregularly cut; the margins are notched (the points
of the notches often turn toward the stem), the edge curling or wavy;
the midribs and netted veins often pucker the surface, which is shining;
the color is a clear full green. They are set on short stems, or
clasp the stalk, and are alternately arranged.</p>

<p>The flower has 4 shell-shaped petals, with very long and erect
bases, of a fine texture, and yellow color with a tinge of green; the
calyx is 4-divided, its parts slender and wide-spreading, also yellow but
with a marked tendency to green. The flowers form close leafy
terminal clusters.</p>

<p>As the petals fall early and only two or three flowers are open at
once, the seed-pods, green and shining, form a distinctive feature of the
plant; when they ripen, and in their turn drop, their little foot-stems
are left bristling along the elongating branch. The leaf suggests
Gothic ornament with its quaint curves and lines.</p>

<p>Found in fallow fields in August.</p>

<p>The stalk, about 3 feet in height, branches near the top, and is
leafy; it is round, but flattened just beneath a joint, smooth, save for
an occasional weak bristle-like hair, and of a shining light green color,
becoming darker and tinged with purplish-red at the joints.</p>

<p>The lower leaves are deeply cleft into 5 or more lobes, the middle
lobe being largest, with irregularly notched margins; the upper leaves
are a narrow oblong shape, but slightly toothed; all the leaves are
loose-textured, hairy underneath, and green, the lower ones having a
yellow tint. They are set on stems, alternately, and at the spring of
the branches.</p>

<p>The 4 petals of the small flower have slender bases, and spread
their tips in the oblong-cross design which gives the family of Mustards
its Latin name; their texture is delicate, and color a pure yellow; the
pistil is green, with a yellow tip, and there are 4 yellow stamens; the
4 calyx-divisions are slender, greenish-yellow, and as long as the base
of the petals which they hold loosely. The flowers form round club-like
clusters, which prolong themselves as the blossoms mature.</p>

<p>The seed-pod is 4-angled, and tipped with the little tenacious
pistil. These light and feathery flowers are seen to best advantage
when, lifting their slender stems above the thickets that congregate in
the lee of old buildings, they show their yellow against the weather-worn
gray-lavender timbers. They love old cellar-holes also, and peep
airily in at the blank windows of deserted houses.</p>

<p>Found blooming inconspicuously from June to October, upon
barrens and waste fields.</p>

<p>The often branching stalk is leafy above the first branch, though
bare below, and grows from 6 to 24 inches in height according to its
opportunities; it is slender but of a woody, tough fibre, and smooth;
gray-green in color.</p>

<p>The narrow small leaf, with its tapering base, is only occasionally
notched, and is of a dusty-green color. The leaves are set on the stalk
alternately, and in little groups.</p>

<p>The very tiny unnoticeable flower has 4 thin, white petals, and 2
little stamens; the green calyx is barely visible. The flowers are set
on thread stems, in loose, stiff, club-shaped and long clusters.</p>

<p>The most important feature of this plant is the seed; as the bloom
moves upward it leaves behind a long stretch of maturing seed-pods,
like little flat discs with a tiny notch at the top; a pungent flavor
belongs to these pods, which is found acceptable by the cosmopolitan
palate of childhood.</p>

<p>Found in bloom during June on dry open hillsides and pastures.</p>

<p>The slightly branching, leafy stalk, which grows from 12 to 15
inches high, is woody-fibred, and slender, and rough to the touch with
short stiff hairs; it is red or tawny in color.</p>

<p>The long narrow oval leaf is pointed at both ends; its edge is
slightly rolled under, and the ribs are prominent and rough beneath;
the texture is strong-fibred, and the surface is rough; its green is
tawny. The leaves are set on short stems, with a pair of wings
(“stipules”) at the junction with the stalk, and occur alternately.</p>

<p>The 5-petaled flower is shaped like a shallow cup of very fine
and thin texture and a clear vigorous yellow color, which is in good
harmony with the many orange-tipped stamens; the 5-pointed calyx is
hairy, and its green is toned with tawny.</p>

<p>A very individual trait of this flower is the fact that the stamens
almost always gather together to one side of the pistil, lying flat upon
a petal, caused by the rude touch of a passing insect, it is said, so
sensitive is this charming plant,—a quality further manifested by the
swift fall of its petals if plucked. The flower never lasts more than a
single day, and but few blossoms are borne on a plant. This is the
first flowering of the Rock-Rose; though ripening the seeds now
formed, there comes a second bloom in the fall whose blossoms are
very small, with few or no petals, clustered in the angles of the leaves,
and bearing but a few seeds. “Generally called ‘Beauties of the Sun’
by the ancients,—‘Sun-roses’ by the English folk.”</p>

<p>Found in woods and moist shade, in May.</p>

<p>The branching, leafy, slightly angular stalk is shining near the
foot, but hairy above, and grows from 5 to 12 inches high. It is light
green. Near the foot a small sheathing leaf may be observed.</p>

<p>The leaf is large, usually broader than it is long, and varying in
form from a round-pointed to a sharp-pointed shape; its ribs show
plainly underneath, its margin is slightly notched, and the surface is
soft and downy to the touch; in color, a clear green, lighter underneath.
The leaves, on their long, grooved stems, grow alternately, with
a pair of up-pointing little wings at the joint.</p>

<p>The lower petal of the flower is scoop-shaped, shallow and short,
and notched into two scallops at the tip, with a very short spur; the 4
other petals are rounding and nearly equal in size. In color, a pure
golden-yellow, with many dark markings on the lower petal, and fainter
lines on the others. The single flowers grow on slender stems from
the angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>The branches are wide-spreading, and the flower-stem springs
away from the leaves with a decided gesture, nor does the Yellow Violet
bend its head; the leaves are generally flat in manner of growth save
for the little scoop at the stem. A few separate leaves on independent
stems rise about the foot of the flowering stalk. This plant bears a
profusion of blossoms, and continues to flower for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Found in May, and again less profusely in August, in forests and
woodlands to the north, or in high regions.</p>

<p>The branching, leafy stalk varies from 6 inches to 2 feet in height;
it is smooth to the touch. Light green in color.</p>

<p>The heart-shaped leaf with its tapering point has a strong midrib,
a slightly notched and wavy margin, and a thin, firm texture; it is a
clear green color. The leaves, on stems, grow alternately, with a pair
of little wings at the stalk; they are gathered close at the ends of the
branches.</p>

<p>The small flower has an inconspicuous spur, its lower broadest petal
is pinched sharply together in the middle at the edge, the other 4 petals
are all long oval, the side petals are bearded and flaring, while the
upper two turn back. The texture of the petals is fine and thin. This
is a two-colored flower—the face of the corolla is white, while the outside
is lavender or dark rich violet; the heart of the blossom is yellow-tinged,
and its markings are in bluish-lavender lines. The 5-parted
green calyx is possessed of a violet lining which it displays to the world
by daintily turning back its uppermost tip. The flowers, on stems,
spring from the angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>Sometimes the lavender facing of the petals is betrayed by a faint
tinge of the color showing through their thin texture. This is an odorous
Violet, and particularly pretty, with a kindly habit of blossoming a
second time in the late summer,—a not uncommon custom in the family,
but followed by no other member with such regularity and generosity
of bloom.</p>

<p>Found in May (later than the Meadow Violet) on dry banks and
gravelly soil.</p>

<p>The leaves and flowers rise from the root on slender stems.</p>

<p>The leaf is deeply divided into 3 or 5 narrow and long parts,
which are sometimes again cleft into 2 or 3 segments; the middle parts
are notched by 2 or 3 rounding scallops, the side parts being shorter,
with taper-pointed tips; the ribs show obscurely, the texture is thickish,
and the surface is dull above and shining underneath; the color
is a dull green. The leaves, on half-rounding stems, that are a darker-hued
green than the leaves, spread widely. The early spring leaves
are less often divided.</p>

<p>This is the largest of the Violet flowers, with 5 flat petals, the
upper ones curling backwards on the stem, and a small, very flat spur;
the texture is fine and close, and the color varies from deep red-violet
to pale lavender, with a dash of white at the base of the lower petals,
just beneath the green-tipped pistil, and dry tawny-orange stamens;
the 5-parted calyx is pale green. The flowers are set on large shining,
smooth stems, which bear a little pair of wings near the ground.</p>

<p>The Bird-Foot Violet flower does not droop, or nod, but holds
itself out at an angle almost parallel with the stem; its bud shows
white, and generally the paler lavender tints prevail in the full-blown
flowers. Many folk-names are given this plant, which grows in little
clumps and sometimes thickly spreads all over a favorably located
sand-barren,—it is often found in burnt-over fields, and stump-lots.
Its flowering season is not so long as many others of its family and
as observed, it seldom blooms again in the autumn.</p>

<p>Found in May on dry and sandy banks.</p>

<p>The stalk branches a little for the flowers, and varies in height
from 6 to 10 inches; it is rough with hairs, and green.</p>

<p>The small, grass-like leaves are rough-hairy, and green; they are
set in pairs, joined about the stalk in a marked cup-like socket; the
pairs occur at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The small flowers commonly have 5 petals apiece, but sometimes
the number is scamped and they are contented with 4 instead;
each petal is so deeply cleft as to give the appearance of being quite
divided; the texture is thin enough to show the veins, the outer
surface is glossy, and the color is white; the calyx has as many sharp-pointed
divisions as there are petals, and is green; the 10 stamens are
pale straw-color. The flowers form little groups on long stems which
spring from the angles of the leaves in pairs.</p>

<p>After the manner of the Pinks this nice little plant sets a blossom
between the fork of the main stems.</p>

<p>Blossoming around dwellings in spring, summer, and autumn.</p>

<p>Its weak-fibred stem, lopping over the ground, is green, and
smooth, with a barely visible little line of hairs down one side.</p>

<p>The small oval leaves have entire edges, and a smooth surface;
they grow in pairs and are of a full green color.</p>

<p>The 5 white petals of the small flower are so deeply notched as to
look like 10 very narrow ones; they are shorter than the 5 green calyx
divisions; the flowers grow singly on short foot-stems, from the leaf-angles.</p>

<p>The Chickweed is a common plant of the dooryard, but without
the usual obnoxious habits of a “weed,—” it is unobtrusive in
demeanor, and, the roots having but a slight hold on the ground,
is easily removed where undesired. It is a natural weather-glass, and
can be trusted not to open its starry eye when rain threatens. The
“Hen’s Inheritance” is an English folk-name for this plant.</p>

<p>Found blossoming in June, in the tall grasses of wet meadows.</p>

<p>This almost thread-like and weak-fibred stalk varies from 6 to 15
inches in height, and is branching and leafy, almost square, with somewhat
roughened angles, and pale green color.</p>

<p>The long grass-like leaves are very taper-pointed at each end, thin,
and smooth, and in color full green, paler underneath; they are set
upon the stalk in pairs, at long intervals.</p>

<p>The flower is small; its 5 petals cleft so deeply as to give the
appearance of double the number, very fine and delicate in texture,
and pure white, the 5-parted spreading calyx being green, while the 10
silky thread-like stamens are white. The flowers, on long, slight stems,
spring singly from the angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>A few-flowered fragile plant, with its tiny star-flowers and sparse
flat leafage, this Stitchwort loves to grow among rank sedges and
swamp grasses, from whose sturdy rectitude it may claim support and
protection.</p>

<p>Found on sandy barrens in blossom during June.</p>

<p>This very modest little plant is seldom more than 2 or 3 inches
high, with its single, round, slender, and smooth stalk of a light green
color, with red rings at the leaf-joints.</p>

<p>The small narrow leaf is entire, flat, a trifle thick in texture, and
dusty green in color. The leaves occur in pairs that box the compass
around the stalk in little groups, and sit very close together; a dry
sheath encircles the stalk at their junction.</p>

<p>The very small flower has 5 scoop-shaped petals, fine in quality,
and pale lilac inclining to pink in color, and several pale yellow stamens;
its 5 calyx-parts are sometimes longer than its petals and are hairy, and
gray-green, with pinkish tips. Two or three flowers occur on the top
of the stalk.</p>

<p>Only one flower opens at a time, but the calyx splits apart and
shows the color of the petals a day before the bud opens. This
smallest of the Pinks grows in such sociable crowds in sandy spots as
to form a thick carpet, very pretty to discover when its close green is
starred with its tiny flowers.</p>

<p>Found on dry soil, by the wayside and in the fields, blossoming in
July through September.</p>

<p>The large leafy stalk, which grows from 1 to 2 feet high, is stout,
slightly rough, and noticeably enlarged at the joints. Its color is green,
or more often a dark crimson.</p>

<p>The oval leaf, tapering at the tip, clasps the stalk at the foot; it
is 3-ribbed and the middle-rib being a little short the blade is fulled to
it on either side; it has a smooth surface, and is of a thick texture; the
color is a grayish-green (usually dusty). The leaves are opposite in
growth.</p>

<p>The flower is large, about 1 inch across, with 5 petals, broad and
slightly notched at the top, and extended down into a narrow stem-like
base, which is confined within the long cylindrical calyx; at the spread
of the broad part of the petal are two little thread-like fringes. The
color runs from white to pink, the 10 stamens are pale yellow, and
the long, 5-notched calyx is a pale yellowish-green. The pistil divides
at the tip into two curling spires.</p>

<p>Stocky and sturdy in growth, hearty and wholesome in nature,
Bouncing Bet grows in great communities along the waysides, and railroad
embankments; it is a little ragged in attire, owing to the habit
the flowers have of drying up in the calyx. It looks its best under a
gray sky.</p>

<p>Found along roadside thickets in July and August.</p>

<p>The sparingly leafy stalk branches in an angular fashion, and
grows from 1 to 3 feet high; although stout, the branches are slender;
it is round, hairy, and sticky to the touch; light green.</p>

<p>The large leaves are sometimes 3 inches long; near the foot they
are oval in shape with a wavy edge, above they are long and narrow;
the margins are entire, the surface hairy and gummy to the touch;
green. They completely clasp the stalk and are united in pairs, the
pairs being set at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The 5 petals of the flower are deeply cleft; where they spread
from the deep tube-shaped calyx, each is provided with a pair of little
notched tags, which form a pretty crown about the throat of the
flower; the texture of the corolla is thin and fine, and the color is pale
pink, or white just tinted with rose; the pale, yellow-green calyx is 5-parted
and elegantly ornamented with 10 branching ribs, or veins, of a
darker color; it is sticky and hairy. The flowers are set on short stems
in the angles of the leaves, in pairs usually, while a single blossom sits
on a short stem, in the fork of the branches.</p>

<p>After blossoming the seed-box changes its shape to round, and
becomes large, the calyx-tips folding together over its top, and the
green pattern of the ribs showing more plainly. There is a faint sweet
perfume about the flowers which may be only discovered at twilight or
in a gray morning, for this is a night-blooming plant.</p>

<p>Found from July till frost-time, in upland fields and pastures.</p>

<p>The slender, angular and jointed stalk is from 8 to 12 inches in
height, occasionally branching, round, smooth and shining. In color
dark green.</p>

<p>The leaf is long and narrow, with a strong midrib, an entire
margin, thin, tough texture, and a downy surface; in color it is rather
a dark and cool green. The leaves, as with all the pinks, clasp the
stalk in pairs with a noticeable joint; the pairs occur at right angles
to each other.</p>

<p>The 5 petals of the small flower are oblong with finely notched
tips; they spread widely, and are of a fine smooth texture, and a deep
rose-pink color, dotted with pale pink specks; the green calyx is
tubular, 5-parted, and downy, and is enfolded by 4 narrow green
bracts. The flowers occur in pairs, from the angles of the leaves, on
short leafy stems.</p>

<p>Sometimes, but not often, two flowers are borne on the same stem;
it has been observed that the flower-stems are of about equal length
with the curving leaves from which they spring. The plant grows in
charming jerks and slants, and like all its kin is neatly finished at the
joints. An October walk seldom fails to discover a few of these
bright-hued Pinks amidst the dying meadow grasses and bare growths
of summer; if the seeds are then gathered and spring-sown in the home
garden this hardy little plant will consent to cultivation.</p>

<p>Found from June to September, in broad sunlight or in shade,
growing in dry or moist soil.</p>

<p>The branching, leafy stalk, 1 or 2 feet high, rather slender and
smooth, is green in color.</p>

<p>The leaves are usually oblong, with a tapering point, but do not
rigorously conform to any model; with entire margins and a thin
texture, which if held to the light is seen to be perforated by tiny
punctures. The color is a full green, and they are set on the stalk in
pairs, the pairs being placed at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The flower is sometimes ¾ of an inch in width, but more often
smaller; the 5 petals are finely notched at the tip and along one side,
their color is a strong yellow turning in maturity to tawny; the calyx
is 5-parted and a light yellow-green modulating between the petal and
leaf colors; the many yellow stamens radiate from the center. The
flowers are set in leafy terminal groups.</p>

<p>This cheery neighbor to the Daisy and Yarrow, though spruce and
pretty when freshly adorned with bloom, is, it must be confessed, a sad
slattern, for it does not shed its withered petals but holds them, ragged
and unkempt, among the newly opened flowers during the long season
of its blossoming. The yellow of the unopened bud is of a noticeably
fine quality.</p>

August.</p>

<p>The slender, very round, fine-fibred stalk, from 12 to 18 inches
high, is noticeably erect in gesture, and bears short angular branches.
Its green is often tinged with a ruddy color.</p>

<p>The leaf is oblong, with an entire margin, and smooth, fine texture;
the perforations are not conspicuous, and the color is a full green.
The arrangement is in pairs.</p>

<p>The 5 petals of the small flower are sharp-pointed, thin, and yellow,
faintly marked with black lines which show more strongly on the outside
than on the inside of the corolla; the calyx is greenish and 5-parted.
The flowers, on short stems, form terminal groups.</p>

<p>This little plant’s habits are in marked contrast to its larger
brother John, for it is as tidy in rolling up into tiny bundles its faded
petals, as the other is careless of appearances. Though its flower is less
conspicuous, the reward, when the plant matures, more than compensates,
for as early as mid-July the upper surface of the leaves take on a
beautiful crimson flush that mingles with the green of the underside,
while the stalk becomes a slender wand of scarlet.</p>

during May and June.</p>

<p>The stalk, single at first, but presently parting into twice-forking
branches, is from 10 to 18 inches in height, and leafy above the
branches; its surface is hairy, and color yellow-green.</p>

<p>The large leaf is 3- to 5-times divided with sharp-pointed tips, an
irregularly toothed margin, distinctly showing ribs, hairy surface;
yellowish-green in color. The leaves are set on stems in pairs, or near
the flowers are placed close together and immediately upon the stalk.
The size is variable, but often quite large.</p>

<p>The flower has 5 rounded petals that are somewhat bearded at the
base; their texture is so fine it plainly shows the veins, the surface is
very smooth, their edges slightly curve, and the color is a delicate
pinkish-lavender; the calyx with its 5 needle-pointed tips is hairy, and
light green; the 10 long stamens are spreading, and the pistil is
5-parted. The flowers, on short stems, are set in pairs, or in a loose,
leafy terminal group.</p>

<p>At the joints of the stems are a pair of leaves and several tiny
leafkins. Though set in occasional pairs the blossoms open one at a
time. It is noticeable that the flowers which open in cool weather, or
in a shady place, are almost crimson in hue, the color being always
very variable. The leafage is especially brilliant in autumn, and
sometimes as early as July a leaf will be found turned to a vivid
scarlet-red. The curious and decorative seed-vessel gives the plant its
fantastic folk-name.</p>

from June to November, though stray flowers may be found in every
month of the year save February.</p>

<p>The widely branching, leafy stalk, from 3 to 18 or more inches in
height, is very slender and apparently weak-fibred, and covered with
soft whitish hairs; it is red or crimson, green only when newly grown.</p>

<p>The leaf is thrice (and sometimes again) divided, with a triangular
spread to its shape; the margin is cut into little rounded notches, each
with a pointed tip; it is very thin in texture, and downy with hairs;
a strong vigorous green in color. The leaves are on long slender stems,
in pairs and groups.</p>

<p>The small urn-shaped flower has 5 wedge-shaped petals, of a
delicate thin texture, and a violet-tinted rose color, rather deep in hue,
and marked with paler lines; the pistil is rose color, the 10 stamens
brownish. The 5 divisions of the hairy calyx hug the petals closely,
and turn their sharp little tips out under their curve; it is pale, with
green veins and margins. The flowers, on their slender stems, are set
in pairs, terminally and along the stalk,—but one of the pair comes into
bloom at once usually.</p>

<p>The stalk, with all its remarkable vitality, is weak at the root, and
the plant is forced to lie somewhat upon the ground or rest against its
sturdier neighbors. It takes kindly to indoor potting, and will bloom
freely through the winter if kept in a cool place.</p>

<p>The branching, leafy stalk, about 6 or 8 inches in height, is
smooth, silky with hairs when newly grown, and a clear, light green
color.</p>

<p>The leaf is compound, with 3 broad, short, heart-shaped leaflets,
that are somewhat folded on the midrib, and are thin, delicate, smooth;
a clear green, paler underneath. The leaves, on their long slender
stems, are alternately arranged.</p>

<p>The 5 spreading petals of the small flower are delicately thin, and
show the veins faintly; they are a bright clean yellow, while the
5-parted shallow calyx is green; the 5 long and 5 short stamens which
are joined together at the base are yellow. The flowers are arranged
in a group of 2 to 6 on a long, light green stem, that springs from the
angle of the leaf-stem and is generally of the same length.</p>

<p>Bud, blossom, and seed-pod may often be seen together on this
plant, as is common to such a prolonged season of bloom. The pod is
5-sided, somewhat fuzzy with down, and bright green. Though hard
to uproot, as the gardener knows, because of its underground runners,
the plant is weak and apt to flop. The leaflets close entirely upon
their midribs at night; their juice is slightly sour, and relished by
children, who detect in its acid taste a sufficient resemblance to the
Red Sorrel (<i lang="la">R. acetosa</i>) to warrant the folk-name given this oxalis.</p>

<p>Found in moist and shaded places from July to September.</p>

<p>This large, branching, leafy plant, from 1 to 3 or 4 feet in height,
is weak-fibred and juicy; its stalk is slightly ribbed, and swollen at
the joints, very smooth, and a pale reddish-green.</p>

<p>The large oval leaf, with its tapering tip and broad base, has a
wide midrib, a coarsely toothed margin, and a thin, weak texture; the
surface is dull, and pale green, with irresolute flecks of red near the
edges. The leaves are alternately placed, on short pale stems.</p>

<p>The curious flower consists of a deep cornucopia-shaped pocket
terminating in a slender hook-like spur, and 5 petal-like parts; the
texture is fine and smooth, and in color it is orange or red-orange,
thickly speckled with tawny-red dots, except the small curving side-parts
which are less strong in hue, and even tinged with green; the 5
stamens are gathered in the mouth of the pocket, beneath the stem.
The flowers swing on slender foot-stems in small groups.</p>

<p>Like all very juicy plants this wilts quickly when plucked. In
bud the wing-like side-parts enfold the pocket. When ripe the seed-pods
burst with a sudden snap that throws the seeds to a considerable
distance; to this trait, and to the singular shape of the flower, are due
the particular favor in which children hold the plant, and afford occasion,
also, for the many by-names by which it is called, such as Snap-Weed,
Silver-Weed, Lady’s Slipper, Lady’s Pocket, and Kicking Colt.</p>

<p>Pale Touch-me-not (<i lang="la">I. pallida</i>) is a light lemon-yellow variety,
very like <i lang="la">I. fulva</i>, though the pocket of the flower is shorter, the spur
less curved, and it is not so numerously spotted.</p>

<p>Found beside walls and in open woods, in June; growing often in
damp soil.</p>

<p>This clambering and twisting vine grows to considerable proportions;
its stems are very tough, and the bark is firm and close, somewhat
shining, and dark gray with occasional bronzy flecks.</p>

<p>The oval leaf, with its many noticeable ribs, finely toothed margin,
and fine texture, is short-stemmed; its color is a cool green, lighter and
shining underneath. The arrangement is alternate.</p>

<p>The greenish-white flowers are small and inconspicuous, their parts
all in fives; they are gathered in loose terminal clusters, which give no
promise of their brilliant fruiting.</p>

<p>With the autumn ripening of the seed, the dry round case becomes
red-orange in color, and bursts into 3 divisions, which curl backward,
with many twisting curves, to display the glistening coral-red fruit.
The drooping clusters of gorgeous orange and scarlet berries keep their
color long, and if gathered just before the seed-cases open, will last all
winter for house decoration.</p>

<p>This is a widely branching, very leafy bush, woody-fibred and
tough, which grows from 2 to 4 feet high, and has a coarse, roughish
bark, slightly grooved, and dull bronzy-green in color.</p>

<p>The oval leaf is sometimes heart-shaped at the base, the veins are
hairy beneath and the margin is irregularly and slightly toothed with
fine points; the texture is loose; it is downy to the touch, and dull
green. The leaves are set alternately on short reddish stems.</p>

<p>The tiny flowers have 5 very slender petals, and are a pinkish-creamy-white;
they are set on white thread-like foot-stems, and
gathered in close thimble-shaped clusters, upon long stems which form
terminal groups. They have a faint sweet odor.</p>

<p>In some localities this thickly blooming shrub is much infested
with insects. The flowers fall quickly, but the pretty little silvery seed-vessels
are retained through the second season.</p>

<p>Found on rich ground, in woods and wayside thickets, blossoming
in July.</p>

<p>This is a high-climbing vine, with tough, woody-fibred stems,
covered with a rough reddish-gray bark.</p>

<p>The large leaf is compound, with the 5 leaflets starting from the
same point; the leaflet is taper-pointed, notched on the edge, smooth,
shining, of a thin texture, and dark green color. The leaves, alternate in
growth, are set on foot-stems 2 or 3 inches long.</p>

<p>The flowers are small, and inconspicuous, with their parts in fives
and of a yellowish-green color; they grow in irregularly branching
clusters from the angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>The round blue-black berries, on thick red stems, ripen in
October. The leaves turn a vivid scarlet, which flames out among the
autumn colors. The vine climbs by the aid of tendrils which terminate
in flat sucker-like discs. It is easily transplanted and often seen
around dwellings.</p>

<p>Found in light woods during May.</p>

<p>The single stalk is flattened beneath the leaf, from 3 to 5 inches
in height, and slender. It is smooth, and strongly tinted with purple,
even with crimson, at the foot.</p>

<p>The lower leaves are small, clasping, and alternate; the upper are
on stems, and form a terminal cluster of 4 or 5 around the flowers,—they
are oval, with an entire margin, and a thick texture, smooth, and
glossy green.</p>

<p>The irregular-shaped flower, like a gayly colored fly, has a very
delicate and fine texture, and is of an exquisite clear crimson tint, the
one fringed petal being white, tinged with a light yellow-green. From
1 to 3 flowers, on their green stems, form a terminal cluster.</p>

<p>These flowers are the idle beauties of the plant; the unnoted
homely Cinderella flower, very small, misshapen, and dull, that sits
down in the dust on a little side-stem close to the root, bears the seeds.
The leaves last over winter, turning a rich crimson-bronze hue, almost
as brilliant as the flowers; the fresh leaves are simultaneous in growth
with the blossoms, unfolding as the buds swell. White varieties are
occasionally found.</p>

<p>The little wiry stalk, which branches near the top for the flowers,
is 6 or 8 inches in height, grooved and twisted, and green in color.</p>

<p>The line-like leaf, with its blunt tip, and entire margin, is somewhat
thick, and its green color carries a hint of crimson. The leaves
are alternate, near together, and clasping.</p>

<p>The very small yellow petals of the flower are hidden within the
calyx, two parts of which are larger than the others, and colored crimson.
The flowers are so placed in a close cylindrical spike that these
crimson calyx-parts are on the outside, overlapping each other in rows
like tiles. These crimson spikes are on long stems that grow terminally,
and from the angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>The flowers bloom in a single row at a time at the bottom of the
spike, which prolongs itself as the buds unfold; when the seeds ripen
the lowest rows fall successively, leaving the brownish stem closely
beset by the little withered foot-stems of the blossoms.</p>

<p>Found in barren sandy fields, in June.</p>

<p>The tough, woody-fibred, round stalk is about 1 or 2 feet high,
erect and leafy, with a rough, hairy surface. The color is light green,
with a considerable showing of red.</p>

<p>The leaf is divided into 5 to 15 long narrow leaflets which radiate
from a common center (“palmate”), each showing a strong midrib,
with an entire margin; the texture is thin, and fine, and pleasing to
the touch; the color is a soft green, paler underneath, showing a hint
of red at the edge, the tip, and again at the stem. The leaves are set
on stems, and arranged in little groups alternately.</p>

<p>The flower has 5 petals: the upper is broad, erect, and much folded
back; the side petals are closed about the lower petal, which is not
observable until the blossom is ready to fall, when it pushes itself, and
the stamens, forward. The upright petal is a deep beautiful red-purple
or dark violet, the side petals are violet, lined with blue, the
lower petal is tipped with purple; the calyx is 2-parted and green.
The flowers, set on short red-purple stems, are arranged loosely in a
long terminal spike. The blossom is odorous.</p>

<p>In bud scarcely a trace of the purple tint shows, petals and calyx
being pink and greenish-white,—even when the upright petal first turns
back, only a few dainty flecks of dark color may be discerned; with
maturity the purple and blue increase in depth. The blossoms at the
base of the spike begin to open earliest. Not the least of the Lupine’s
attractions is the graceful curve of the stalk,—rarely is the flower-spike
stiffly erect. It is a communistic plant, spreading all over a sand plain
and making it a field of blue in blossom time, the roots buried firmly
and to a surprising depth in the loose soil.</p>

<p>The climbing, leafy stalk grows from 1 to 2 feet high; it is tough-fibred,
and much grooved with fine lines. Color, green.</p>

<p>The compound leaf is composed of 20 or more side leaflets, and
terminates in a tendril; the leaflets are small and narrow, and are
tipped with little needle-like bristles; the surface is finely downy. The
leaves, on very short stems, are alternate and clasping by a pair of
half-arrow-shaped wings. The color is grayish-green.</p>

<p>The flower is small, and shaped like the bean blossom; its color is
a fresh, light, bluish-violet tint, the broad upper petal being faintly
lined with darker violet; the calyx is unequally 5-parted, and colored
like the corolla. The flowers are densely crowded in long, one-sided
curving spikes that grow from the angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>The leafage of this plant affords a good example of the refined
green generally found accompanying flowers of a blue or violet hue;
its stalk is perhaps a little awkward in gesture, but not so the flexible
curving flower-clusters. It grows in communities, and seen from a
little distance forms a beautiful mass of blue.</p>

rich, dark gray-green color. The leaves are alternate, on very short
foot-stems.</p>

grow along the ends of the branches, in slender, elongated clusters, or
spires,—the clusters sometimes branch, and are sometimes leafy.</p>

<p>Both the flower and leaf in withering turn black. The plant is

<p>The smooth, tough stalk, growing from 3 to 4 feet high, is light
green in color.</p>

<p>The compound leaf has from 6 to 9 pairs of narrow oblong leaflets;
the midrib of each leaflet extends a little beyond the margin at
the tip of the blade; the surface is smooth, and the texture firm and
fine. The foot-stems of the leaves show the gland-like swellings
frequently seen in members of this family. The leaves are alternate,
and green in color, tending toward yellow-green, lighter beneath.</p>

<p>The flower has 5 slightly unequal petals, 3 standing close together,
and 2 spreading more widely, while the calyx has 5 long divisions
turned backward; there are 10 stamens in 3 sets—one set of 3 is short
and rounded at the tip, a second set of 4, opposite the first, is somewhat
longer, while the third set of 3 is longer still. The petals and stamens
are of a rich soft yellow, the latter being tipped with a very dark
brown, while the calyx is a fine greenish-yellow. The blossoms are in
loose clusters, on short flower-stems, from the angles of the upper
leaves.</p>

<p>The fineness of texture, and the quality of color, accentuated by
the irregular dashes of dark of the stamen-tips, give to the Wild Senna
the distinguishing air of “style.” The leaves seem slightly sensitive to
the touch, and inclined to droop with much handling.</p>

usually blossoming in August and September.</p>

<p>A vine: climbing over low vegetation by aid of its slender,
twining, green stem.</p>

<p>The 3 leaflets of the compound leaf are very broad across the
middle, especially the middle one, which is almost diamond-shaped; the
margin is entire, the surface almost smooth, and the texture exceedingly
thin; at the juncture of the foot-stem with the blade, and with the
main stem, are small gland-like swellings; the alternate leaves, on slender
stems, are of a light yellowish-green.</p>

<p>The slender pea-shaped blossom is lavender-tinted, with a pale
green 4- to 5-notched calyx; the flowers grow in groups of from 4 to 7,
on the end of a short flower-stem, that springs from the angle of the
leaf.</p>

<p>The flowers occasionally ripen pods about 1 inch long, holding
from 3 to 4 brown-mottled, bean-like seeds. The vine is said also to
form subterranean seeds from rudimentary flowers, the seed being
enclosed in a fleshy, pear-shaped pod; this perhaps may have been
thought a good reason for giving to a slender and well-behaved little
vine the opprobrious folk-name of Hog-Pea-nut! But those who
know its true character will never degrade it to so low a level!</p>

<p>The leaf is compound; the 3 leaflets are oval, slightly notched, or

<p>The stalk (from 8 to 12 inches in height) is branching, leafy at
intervals, and curving in growth; it is slender, round, and finely
grooved. Color light green, speckled with dull crimson.</p>

<p>The leaf is compound, the 3 leaflets small and narrow; the margin
is finely notched, the texture delicate and smooth to the touch; the
color is a cool light green, with no clover-markings. The leaf is set on
slender grooved stems, with a pair of flaring wings at the junction with
the stalk; the arrangement is alternate.</p>

<p>The small flower is very like the White Clover, but tinted a
beautiful rose color. Set in a loose, small, round head, on a terminal
or side stem.</p>

<p>When advanced in age the lower flowers of the head turn downwards,
after the manner of the White Clover, which it closely resembles
except for the color. It is honey sweet in perfume.</p>

<p>Found, from June to September, growing in meadows, fields, and
waysides.</p>

<p>The stalk (from 6 to 15 inches high) is rather large, branching,
leafy, strong-fibred, grooved slightly, and roughened by the presence of
short hairs. Color, light green.</p>

<p>The leaflets are 3, of varying shape, oval, long oval, or heart-shaped;
the margin is slightly irregular, the texture thin; the color is
a fine cool green, lighter underneath, and the upper surface of each
leaflet is marked with a pale triangular patch in the middle. The leaf
is set on a slender stem, with a pair of bristly-pointed, woolly, green
and white, membrane-like wings at the junction of the stalk; the
arrangement is alternate.</p>

<p>The corolla is large, its upper petal narrow and erect; in color, all
shades of crimson to a violet tint. The 5-parted calyx has long thread-like
feathery tips; it is light green. The flower-head is large, close,
and round or oval; it is set on a terminal or side stem. Beneath the
head, like a collar, are found 3 membrane-like leaves.</p>

<p>The violet-crimson flower-head is modified, by the green calices,
into excellent harmony with the fine cool green of the leafage.</p>

<p>Found, during June and July, in dry fields and waysides.</p>

<p>The stalk branches slightly, and is leafy; it is slender, round, and
smooth, and grows from 6 to 12 inches high. The color is light green.</p>

<p>The 3 leaflets of the compound leaf are long and narrow, with an
exceedingly fine texture and smooth surface. The leaves, on very
short stems, are placed in groups, or singly and alternately, upon the
stalk; at the base of the stem, and uniting with it for half its length,
occur a pair of enfolding wings.</p>

<p>The flowers are very small, and gathered into a close head, that is
set on a little stem growing from the angle of a leaf; the corollas are
yellow, the minute calices being green.</p>

<p>The flowers open from the bottom of the head upward, the mature
blossoms becoming dry and husky, and turning down after the manner
of the hop, as the bloom continues towards the summit; the heads
thus show a harmonious gradation of color from brownish-yellow at
the base, through yellow, to the yellow-green of the buds at the top
of the head. The plant often grows in clumps of a considerable size.</p>

<p>The slender, branching stalk varies from 4 to 10 inches in height,
and is smooth, or slightly rough, and light green.</p>

<p>The leaf has 3 long, narrow, and blunt-pointed leaflets,—their
midribs conspicuous to the very tips; the margin is entire, the texture
fine and downy to the touch, and the color is a rather light green. The
leaves, on short stems, are arranged alternately and near together.</p>

<p>The small, greenish-white corolla is shorter than the calyx, which
is long, and green, with 5 feathery tips that are rose colored and give
to the head its peculiar gray-pink hue. The flower-heads are oblong;
2 or more are found on a branch.</p>

<p>A faint perfume belongs to the newly opened flowers. Doubtless
the children’s name, “Pussy Plant,” points to the resemblance the silky,
green-rose head bears to the pussy-willow catkins.</p>

<p>The 3 leaflets of the compound leaf are long and narrow, or a
pointed-oblong shape, widest near the abruptly-tapering tip; the margin
is very slightly irregular, except for a sharp little needle-point at the
tip; the surface is downy. Each leaflet is provided with a tiny foot-stem,
the middle having the longest one. The color is a cool green,
lighter underneath; without markings. The leaves are set on slender
stems, arranged in groups, alternately; a pair of slender, fine wings
occur at the junction of the stalk.</p>

<p>The flower is smaller than that of the Crimson Clover; it has a
fine texture, and the petals are a pure purple color, the upper petal,
which is much curled back, being marked with delicate dark lines; the
small calyx is pale green. The flower-head is a short and club-shaped
spike.</p>

<p>An individual trait is the charming little jerk in the line at the
spring of the central leaflet.</p>

<p>Found on sandbanks and in dry shade in July.</p>

<p>The root sends up a flower-stem, pale, slender and about 2 feet in
height, and a stout, woody leaf-stem which is shorter, and gray.</p>

<p>The 3 leaflets of the compound leaf are broad-oval, entire, with
many ribs and veins showing in the thin, somewhat papery texture, that
is rough and dry to the touch; the color is grayish-green, paler underneath.
Three or four leaves on their long strong stems are close set,
one above the other, in an apparent whorl upon the summit of the short
stem already described. Leaves occur also upon the flower-stems.</p>

<p>The flower is small; the upper petal is notched at the tip, and
much turned back; the 4 others are caught by thread-like bases in the
shallow 5-parted calyx; they are a clear lilac and white, the upper petal
being marked with two purple patches; the calyx is pale reddish. The
flowers on red foot-stems are arranged in little groups in a long spire
upon the long stem which rises from the root.</p>

<p>One flower only blooms at a time. A tiny pointed leaf, or bract,
as long as the calyx, is folded over the bud, but falls when the petals
expand.</p>

in August.</p>

<p>This is a twining vine, leafy, rather slender, and slightly rough to
the touch. In color, green, sometimes tinged with a dull red.</p>

<p>The leaf is compound, usually of 5 or 7 leaflets; these are oval,
largest at the base, and tapering to the tip; the margin is entire, the
fibre strong, and the surface slightly rough; color, a strong, full green.
The leaves are alternate at intervals, springing from a strong joint.</p>

<p>The upper petal of the flower is broad, and hood like, the middle
folded petal is like a beak beneath it, the side petals narrow and
hanging like ribbons to tie the hood. Its color is brown-pink, the hood
and beak darkest on the inside. The flowers are clustered together in
a dense rounded head, set on a short stem that springs from a leaf-joint.</p>

<p>The front view of this flower carries out the fantastic suggestion of
the hood shaped petal, for the beak looks like a strongly hooked nose
far under its shadow. It is odorous.</p>

<p>Found during May and June in pastures, and fields, and copse-borders.</p>

<p>The leaf and flower stems, from 6 to 8 inches high, spring from the
root, with dry sheaths enclosing them at the ground.</p>

<p>The leaf is compound, the 8 leaflets wedge-shaped; the margin is
deeply toothed, and the many ribs show plainly; loose of texture, and
roughened underneath with hairs. In color a rich strong green, paler
beneath, sometimes reddish, or pink. The stem is hairy; green, and
reddish near the foot.</p>

<p>The flower has 5 rounded petals with pointed bases; its texture is
thin; pure white in color; the stamens many and orange-yellow. The
petals are set daintily around the base of the little green cone, that
later becomes the berry, showing the 5 broad divisions of the calyx
between; just beneath the calyx, and alternate with its tips, occur 5
narrow bracts which lie so tightly underneath as to appear to belong
to it. The flowers, on short foot-stems, are placed in groups on
larger leafy stems, these forming a loose terminal cluster set on the
hairy stem which rises from the roots.</p>

<p>After the petals fall, the calyx turns up its tips to protect the fruit,
which droops, as it reddens and becomes pulpy. The young leaf, as it
rises from the ground, is close-folded like a delightful little green fan;
the first leaves often lie flat upon the ground, and are rusty in color.
The Strawberry has a pleasant way of bursting into a flurry of bloom
late in August; along wood-paths and unfrequented lanes one comes
upon it as a belated bit of spring. He who has smelled the exquisite
fragrance of the field strawberry fruit will not soon forget its wild charm.</p>

<p>Found in pastures during June.</p>

<p>This lovely, branching, leafy bush grows to be 7 or 8 feet high
under favoring conditions, but is most often about 3 or 5 feet in height;
its stalks and branches are large and strong, round, firm-fibred, and
smooth, with frequent slender thorns which curve backward. In color,
a full clear green when young, only dashed with red-bronze, but becoming
red-brown when old. The thorns are highly polished, and of a
strong red color when old.</p>

<p>The little leaflets, of the 3- to 7-divided leaf, are oval, with a prominent
midrib (upon which they are occasionally creased); the margin is
doubly notched, the ribs and foot-stems hairy with little prickles; the
upper surface is soft to the touch, while the under is slightly sticky
with a resinous gum, which yields a delicious aromatic perfume. The
color is a cool and beautiful green. The leaves clasp the stalk with a
pair of small fine-pointed wings (“stipules”); they are placed alternately,
either singly or in groups, and close together.</p>

<p>The flower is composed of 5 heart-shaped petals, curving like a
shell, of an exquisitely delicate texture and smoothness; their color a
lovely creamy-rose tint. The stamens are many, curling, and pale straw
color. The calyx is 5-parted, the spreading tips notched 3 or 5 times;
they are smooth, with a velvet lining which is tinted a very pale creamy-green,
while the outside of the calyx is bright green. The flowers are
set in groups on little twigs, and scattered profusely along the stalks.</p>

<p>When the flower opens, the calyx-tips turn back. The haws are
large, and of a brilliant coral-red color which they retain through the
winter. The sturdy young shoots, which grow rapidly, are thickly protected
by long bristles of a rusty red color. An element of beauty, in
the growth of this most perfect rose, exists in the free curve with
which its branches bend downward their wreaths of bloom. The odor
of the leaves is like that of green apples.</p>

firm, close texture, the ribs bristly underneath. In color a fine rich
green. The leaves are alternately placed, and clasp the stalk with a
pair of flaring, narrow wings (“stipules”).</p>

<p>The petals are 5, heart-shaped, and shell-like, the texture is thin,

center. The bright green calyx-divisions are 5, long and narrow, deeply
and sharply cleft, covered with bristles. The flowers on leafy stems,
are placed, terminally, or along the branches, in pairs, or singly.</p>

<p>The blossoms are odorous, and abundant,—their petals are beautifully
curved. The plants grow in thick plantations, and are partial to
upland pastures, where they contest their rights with the Hardhack,

<p>The stout, rather large stalk, branches a great deal and is very
leafy; it varies from 2 to 4 or more feet, and is generally quite without
prickles. The new shoots are green, tinged with pink, and show a
slight bloom; the old growths (they become woody-fibred) are dark
red.</p>

<p>The leaflets are 3 to 7 in number, large and often blunt at the tip,
many ribbed, with noticeably toothed margins usually, and a grooved
mid-stem. The color is cool green, rather dark, underneath white or
pale with bloom. The leaf is set on a short stem, scarcely longer than
the conspicuous wings, with which it clasps the stalk; these have
pointed tips and are finely toothed, and are green, with a dash of red
in the stem. The leaves are close together.</p>

<p>The flower is large and odorous, the 5 petals being broad and
curving; in color a glowing rich crimson, pale near the center. The
stamens are many, and yellow; the pistils gathered in a flat disc are
green or nearly yellow. The calyx is very smooth, the divisions
shorter than the petals and downy within; it is a bright clear green.
The flowers are set singly, or in groups. The foot-stem is short; midway
it bears a pair of pointed leafkins, and at its junction with the
stalk a pair of large, oval, toothed leaf-like wings occur.</p>

<p>For profusion of bloom this is a good variety in cultivation, to
which it takes kindly, since it remains vigorous and free from blight
when its paler sisters show their longing for their old wild life. The
hips are large and red. Bristles are sometimes found on the new
shoots.</p>

<p>Found in roadside thickets in early June.</p>

<p>This large, stout, stalk varies from 2 to 6 feet in height; it
branches toward the top, is round, and grooved, and armed with strong
recurved thorns; the new shoots are furnished with short, coarse hairs.
The color in the old stalks is a vigorous russet-red, while the young
growths are green.</p>

<p>The leaf is divided sometimes into 3 leaflets and sometimes into 5,
each leaflet being set on a short foot-stem with the end one a little
longer than the others; the margins are coarsely toothed, the ribs
deeply marked, the texture coarse, and the surface covered with short
hairs; the stem and midrib are furnished underneath with small strong
prickles. The color is a coarse, warm green. The leaves are placed
alternately, with narrow leafy wings at the stalk.</p>

<p>The 5 oblong petals of the flower taper into a narrow claw at the
base; the color is pure white; the 5, pointed, light green calyx-parts
alternate with the petals; the stamens are many, thread-like, and tipped
with dark brown, while the several pistils form a rounding, pale green
bunch in the center. The flowers, on their light green stems, form
large cone-like clusters on the ends of the stalks.</p>

<p>The old canes are noticeable in winter and early spring for their
fine russet-red, as they grow in plantations on the hillsides and along
the lanes; this strong red coloring comes out in the autumn leafage,
dark and rich though subdued in hue, and is held late in the vigorous
fibre of the leaf. The gracefully formed flower blooms in profusion,
early, though the fruit is longer than the other Blackberries in maturing;
the fruit-clusters add another attractive feature to the plant,
which is known as “only a common Bramble.”</p>

<p>Found in dry fields, banks, and roadsides in June and July.</p>

<p>The stalk trails and runs; it is leafy, stout, and woody-fibred, with
few, and small, prickles. In color dark red.</p>

<p>The leaf is divided into 3, or 5, or 7 leaflets of an oval shape, the
middle one generally being wedge-shape, and set on a short stem; the
margins are sharply toothed. The color is a full, vigorous green.</p>

<p>The flower petals are 5, long, rounded at the tip and tapering at
the base; in color they are pure white. The stamens and pistils are
pale; the 5-parted calyx is a pale silvery green. The flowers grow
singly, or loosely clustered in twos and threes.</p>

<p>The blossom of the Dewberry is sweet-scented, with a fragrance
resembling that of the Anemone, or Adder’s-tongue. Its berry has
fewer, and larger grains, than the High-bush berry; when favorably
developed it has a fine wild flavor.</p>

<p>Found in swamp lands, grassy woods, and copse borders during
June and July.</p>

<p>The trailing, rather slender, stalk runs on the ground in varying
lengths; its prickles are few and weak. The color is green and brown.</p>

<p>The leaf is small, usually with 3 leaflets that are broad-oval or
wedge-shaped; the margins are toothed, ribs marked, and the surface
is smooth and shining, while the fibre is tough. The color is dark
green.</p>

<p>The 5 small flower-petals are white; the stamens and pistils
many, but inconspicuous; the calyx 5-parted, and pale green. The
small clusters of two or three blossoms spring from the new shoots.</p>

<p>The fruit is scanty, and small. The pretty, dark, glossy, green
leaves turn a rich dull bronzy-red in the fall, and remain so throughout
snow-time,—they form a pleasing incident in the bouquet, gathered by
the lover-of-the-woods-in-winter.</p>

<p>Found among wayside tangles, and uplands, in July and August.</p>

<p>The branching, leafy, stalk grows from 3 to 5 feet high; it is large,
of a tough, woody-fibre, and the surface is roughened by short sticky
hairs. The color is rusty green, and reddish-brown.</p>

<p>The large leaf in general shape resembles a maple leaf, with 3 or 5
lobes, a tapering point, and a toothed margin; the ribs and veins form
a strongly-marked network, the texture is loose, and the surface is somewhat
rough. The color is a strong, full-toned, yellowish-green. The
leaves are alternate in growth, and are set on long stems.</p>

<p>The large flower is rather like a Rose in appearance, with 5 large,
rounded petals, and many light yellow stamens forming a ring around
the center. The color of the freshly opened petals is a deep, bright
crimson, becoming pale, and duller with time. The 5-parted, light
green calyx is covered with small, sticky, red hairs, and the flower-stems
are also sticky. They grow in loose clusters, from the ends
of the branches.</p>

<p>On cool or cloudy days the blossoms show a deep clear color, not
to be discerned on hot days which speedily change them to a light
bluish-pink. The fruit resembles that of the red raspberry, though it
is a much shallower cup shape; the plant continues flowering after the
berries begin to ripen. The bush is large and shrubby in growth, with
many leaves.</p>

<p>The bushy stalk bears many branches, and is very leafy; between
2 and 3 feet in height; it is round, strong and firm-fibred, and
covered with a very thin, fine bark of a beautiful, glossy, golden-bronze
hue.</p>

<p>The pretty leaf is oval, with a pointed tip, and finely notched
margin; the ribs are prominent underneath, the texture is firm, the
upper surface is smooth, while it is slightly rough underneath. In
color it is a full green, lighter somewhat underneath, the midrib pale.
The leaves are set on short up-springing stems, and the arrangement is
close and alternate.</p>

<p>The small petals are 5 in number, shell-like, and pinkish-white;
there are many rosy stamens; the calyx is small, 5-parted, and pale
green. The flowers are set on thread foot-stems in little loose spires,
that form a large, leafy terminal spire.</p>

<p>Like the Hardhack (<i lang="la">S. tomentosa</i>) the leaves turn upward, with a
little arch in the stem; the central flower-spire blossoms first. The
plant has a great elegance of line, and some of its details are admirable,
such as the color of the stalk, and the especially pretty light brown
seed-spires; the bark frequently splits into long shreds. The blossoms
are fragrant.</p>

<p>Found in open pastures, hillsides and lanes, during July and
August.</p>

<p>The stalk bears prim branches, and is very leafy; woody-fibred,
and strong, the surface being woolly. Pinkish-brown in color.</p>

<p>The leaf is oval, with a strong midrib, and a notched margin; the
under surface is covered with wool of a whity-green color, the upper is
full green in tone. The leaves, on scarcely perceptible stems, spring
from the stalk with a strong and noticeable arch, which points them
upwards; they are placed close together, and alternately.</p>

<p>The 5 petals are very small, round or slightly oval in shape, rosy-pink
in color, as are the many stamens, which give a feathery look to
the blossoms. The small calyx is 5-parted, and green. The flowers
are crowded in small spires, that are arranged closely in a fine-pointed
terminal spire, which is often 3 inches in length.</p>

<p>The flowers open first at the tip of the spire, which thus frequently
turns to pale brown, before the light green buds at the base begin to
swell. The ripened seed-spires of the previous year, dried to a rich
gray-red, or deep brown, are retained during the flowering season, and
add much to the attractiveness of the plant. The upturned undersides
of the leaves are often tinted with pale rose color, as though reflected
from the blossoming spire; all along the middle of the stalk they are
larger than at the foot, or near the flowers. Upland slopes, which offer
favoring conditions to the plant, take on a <span class="cor" title="Source: perce ptible" id="cor164">perceptible</span> tone of pink
during the blossom-time because of its numerous presence,—it is unfortunate
that farmers rate this gregarious habit as pestiferous.</p>

September.</p>

<p>The zigzag branching stalk varies from 10 to 18 inches in height,
and bears few leaves; it is tough, coarse fibred, and rough with hairs;
it rises from a foot-tuffet of leaves. Of a brownish green color.</p>

<p>The root-leaves are large, and 3-divided into round, unequal, parts,
with a round-scalloped margin, that is often wavy; and set on long
hairy stems,—along which are sometimes scattered other indeterminate
little leaflets; the upper leaves are simple, and narrow, or deeply 3-cleft,
with uneven sharp-notched margins, and set on long stiff stems, which
clasp the stalk with a pair of 3-notched wings; a few small leaves near
the flowers are set close on the stalk clasping with small narrow
wings. The surface is hairy, texture loose, and coarse; the color a
crude green; the arrangement alternate.</p>

<p>The flower has 5 petals, oval shaped, with fine-pointed bases; the
texture is thin and delicate, the edges curly; clear white in color; the
stamens are fine, tipped with yellow; the many green pistils are
gathered in a small conical head; the calyx is 5-parted, and green, with
white edges; between the divisions is found a tiny thread-like point.
The flowers are set on slender, leafy stems, which are terminal, and
from the angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>The petals are so widely spread that the calyx is seen, from above,
as a fine-pointed green star; after they fall the head develops long,
wiry, green hooks, with which to grapple the heedless traveller. The
growth is angular, and weedy.</p>

<p>The small single stalk (from 1 to 2 feet in height) is dry fibred, and
hairy. Green in color.</p>

<p>The leaflets are many, 5 to 7 usually, with small unformed leafkins
irregularly placed between them upon the long stem; the leaflets are
oval, and many ribbed, with toothed margins, of a loose texture, and
hairy to the touch. The color is a strong green. The stem is hairy,
clasping with a pair of flaring, toothed or entire wings. The leaves
are alternate, and near together.</p>

<p>The small flower has 5 oval, short petals of fine texture, and a full

<p>When crushed the leaf exhales a faint spicy odor. The slender
spire seldom holds itself stiffly erect, but bends and curves to one side,
like a pretty green and gold plume; its seeds, round and rather flat,
are sticky, and apt to go a’ travelling without an invitation, with the
footman.</p>

<p>Found, from May to July, about dwellings and in pastures, and
light shade; in sandy soil.</p>

<p>The root sends up a bunch of leaves, from which many long,
slender, reddish runners spread; they vary much in length.</p>

<p>The compound leaves are 3-divided, with an appearance of being
5-parted the side leaflets are so deeply cleft into 2 divisions; the
leaflets are wedge-shaped with noticeable ribs, sharply-toothed margin,
thin texture, and downy surface. The color is a strong, full green,
lighter underneath. The leaves, on long stems, rise from the root, or
on very short stems are arranged along the running stems, in little
groups, at rather long intervals apart.</p>

<p>The 5 heart-shaped petals of the flower are delicate in texture, and
light pure yellow in color; the calyx is 5-parted, the divisions alternate

closely,—all these parts are hairy, and green. The flowers, on slender
stems, spring from the angles of the leaves, along the runners.</p>

<p>Sometimes the stems lift themselves nearly erect, but more often
they lie upon the ground, where occasionally they throw out roots from
the tufted leaves, and so cover the earth with a pretty interlacing network
of green leaves, and red stems.</p>

<p>This bushy, branching, and very leafy plant grows from 1 to 3 or 4
feet high; it is tough, and woody-fibred, with a thin bark, roughened by
hairs. Dull tawny-brown in color, dark at the foot. The new shoots

<p>The leaf is divided in 3 to 7 long, narrow, and oblong leaflets that
are pointed at each end, with entire margins, the edge being rolled
under; the texture is thick, and the surface hairy. In color a dull
yellow-green, the under surface whitish. The leaves, on short slender
stems, are placed in little groups, close together.</p>

<p>The flower is larger than those of the other Cinquefoils described;
of 5 rounded petals, with slender bases, fine texture and smooth surface;
strong yellow in color. There are many short, dark-tipped stamens.
The calyx is 5-parted, with an equal number of alternating bracts
beneath; it is shining smooth on the inside and downy without; yellow-green,
the bracts being greener,—they are also less downy. The flowers,
on short downy stems, form leafy close terminal groups.</p>

<p>Possessed of an almost indestructible toughness, and rapid in
growth, this plant is one of the worst of pests, sometimes usurping a
whole field, from which it is a formidable task to dislodge it. It has
been largely introduced into western Vermont through garden cultivation.
The petals fall quickly; seen in great masses the general hue is
coarse and unpleasing.</p>

<p>Found blossoming in April and May, in rocky grounds and
hillsides.</p>

<p>The leaves and flowering stems, from 4 to 9 inches in height, rise
from the root.</p>

<p>The small oval leaves have rounded tips, short broad foot-stems,
and scalloped edges; their texture is thick and smooth, and their color
a vigorous green. They form a close round tuffet upon the ground.</p>

<p>The small flowers have 5 long white petals and 10 yellow stamens
apiece; their light green calices are 5-parted; and they grow in open
clusters on the summit of a thick, round, and downy stem, which rises
from the middle of the leafy rosette.</p>

<p>The buds appear already formed, early in the spring; as soon as
the snow leaves the ground they appear as a small, round green ball
well settled down in the middle of the leaf-tuffet; this bunch of buds
pushes itself boldly up, on its thick stem, which is still quite short
when the flowers begin to open. As the stem lengthens the clustered
flowers become less dense until, finally, it reaches its full height, and
the blossoms, fully expanded, spread loosely apart; they remain in
perfection a long time—two or three weeks. The roots of this hardy
plant, pushing in among the crevices of the rocks, fracture them by
their vigorous growth; this gives it the name of Saxifrage or Rock-Breaker.</p>

<p>Found on moist banks and in light woods in May.</p>

<p>Leaves and flowering stems, to the height of 8 to 15 inches, or
more, spring from the root.</p>

<p>The leaf is somewhat triangular in shape, with a pointed tip and
deeply heart-shaped base; 3- to 5-lobed, each lobe being slightly cut
into 3 or 5 notches, the ribs and veins noticeable, the texture thin and
loose, and hairy on both sides, the underside being also glossy; in
color a full green. The leaf is borne singly on a long very hairy stem,
which is tinged with red near the foot. Small, very short-stemmed
leaves also occur in single pairs upon the flower-stems.</p>

<p>The flower is small, exquisitely shaped, with its 5 white petals cut
into little branching threads in the semblance of a snow crystal; the 10
little yellow stamens just show within their hollow center; the yellow-white
cup-shaped calyx is slightly 5-parted. The flowers are set on
tiny foot-stems, and arranged in a spire upon a tall, slender, somewhat
hairy stem.</p>

<p>Several leaves and two or three flower spires rise from the earth

<p>Found on wooded slopes, in moist nooks during May.</p>

<p>The root throws out slender runners, which bear leaves, and
flowers on upright, 4- to 8-inch long, hairy stems.</p>

<p>The leaf is heart-shaped at the base, its lobes overlapping the
stem, and the margin is cut and toothed irregularly into a faint semblance
of a maple-seedling leaf; the edge is slightly curling, the
noticeable ribs are hairy underneath, and the fibre is coarse; the color
is green, often speckled with rusty spots.</p>

<p>The 5 small, pointed petals spread alternately with the 5 blunt-tipped
calyx-parts; the flower is all pure white, except for the orange
tips to the 10 stamens; the long, sharp-pointed pistil is conspicuous.
These pretty feathery flowers, on their little foot-stems, are arranged in
a loose spike, borne by the long, sometimes leafy, flower-stem.</p>

<p>Nancy spreads rapidly, carpeting the earth with its close-growing
flat leaves above which the flower-spires rise alertly. The foliage turns
brown and gray early in the summer.</p>

<p>A bush, from 4 to 5 feet high, with a branching, woody stem,
covered with a gray bark.</p>

<p>The leaf is lobed after the manner of the currant leaf, with a heart-shaped
base, and toothed margin; the veins are numerous, the surface
smooth, and the color a fall green. The leaves, on inch-long foot-stems,
which widen at the base, and are fringed along the edges with light,
weak hairs, grow in small alternate clusters on the branches.</p>

<p>The bell-shaped flower is 5-parted at the top, the divisions rounded
and recurved; the small petals are set within the large calyx-bell, alternating
with 5 tiny stamens; the color is a pale greenish-yellow. Each
flower bell hangs on a short stem, with a narrow leaflet at its foot;
from six to ten, or more, bells droop in a cluster, from the angles of
the leaves.</p>

<p>The small fruit is black.</p>

<p>Found in rocky soil, along roads and in door-yards, blossoming
during August.</p>

<p>Its very leafy and branching stalk, from 1 to 2 feet high, is large
and round and juicy; very smooth, and pale green, inclining to pink
near the blossoms.</p>

<p>The broad, oval leaf, with its stout midrib, and slightly scalloped
margin, is thick, tough, and juicy; the surface is very smooth, and the
color a light gray-green, pale on the underside with a bloom, and
moist to the touch. The leaves clasp the stalk alternately, and very
close together, from foot to flower.</p>

<p>The small richly-hued flower has 5 sharp-pointed petals, which
spread widely, and are colored a full crimson or garnet; the 5-parted
green calyx being also toned with red. The flowers form a close, round,
terminal cluster.</p>

<p>Shrugged down among the close gathered leaves the bloom has a
jewel-like effect of glowing color, and the seed-cases take on a deep red
hue which prolongs its season of beauty as a compensation for its infrequent
flowering. The plant’s endurance during droughts and
tenacious hold on life are remarkable; a cut stalk has been observed
full of unwithered bloom a fortnight after the farmer’s scythe had
swept the roadside. To children its charm lies in the power of inflation
which belongs to the easily separated skin of the leaves.</p>

<p>Found on swampy ground in July and August.</p>

<p>A little plant growing close to the earth and sending up a flowering
stem about 3 or 4 inches in height.</p>

<p>The small, round leaves, slightly hollowed like a shallow saucer,
are tough, light green in color, and covered with short, curling, red hairs
that exude a clear gummy liquid from their tips; they are set on short,
flat stems, and arranged in a tuffet.</p>

<p>The small flower has its parts sometimes in fives and again in
sixes; their white petals are rounded at the tips, and the calyx is light
green; they are placed in a close, one-sided spire, that curls over at the
tip, on the top of a slender, erect, red stem, rising from the middle of
the leaf-cluster.</p>

<p>The red hairs on the leaves tipped with clear fluid sparkle as
though with dew; this is the gummy substance that catches the unwary
insects which alight and detains them to their everlasting doom,—it
is said that this hairy little vegetable has a cannibal’s appetite for
flesh, and draws nourishment from these victims. The Sundew grows
close among the pale green swamp-moss, and can only be detected by
close observation; when in bud it can be more easily discovered
through its red flower-stem. It is extremely difficult to find it in
blossom or to decide as to the conditions favorable to its unfolding,—when
at length surprised, it will be found with only one flower open,
its face set toward the zenith.</p>

<p>Found from late September to November, by woodland pools,—near
water always.</p>

<p>This is a shrub, or small tree, from 6 to 12 feet in height, with wide-spreading
branches, very tough fibre, and a tight, firm bark, smooth and
shining at the tips, of a mottled gray-brown color.</p>

<p>The large oval leaf, with its broad, flat shape, has a wavy and
irregularly notched margin, many strong ribs, a tough texture, and a
surface which is shining above, and hairy along the underside of the
ribs; of a vigorous green color,—in autumn a strong gray-yellow. The
leaves, on stout little foot-stems, are alternate.</p>

<p>The flower has 4 slender ribbons for petals, and 8 stamens (only 4
of which bear anthers), of a delicate greenish-yellow color; the calyx
is small, and parted into 4 sharp divisions which show in the form of a
square between the petals; it is downy, thin, and pale tawny in color.
Beneath the calyx are 2 or 3 little bracts; and tough, bark-like, brown
outer bracts hold 2 or 3 flowers in a close group upon a short stem;
these groups are scattered all along the branches in the angles of the
leaves.</p>

<p>Nothing of the spring approaches the mystery of this flower. Late
in autumn the straggling Witch Hazel bushes, standing about a pool of
dark water in front of bare woods, lift their full tawny leafage and
evasive pale golden bloom against the lavender twiggery, and purple-gray
sky, filling the air with their strange fragrance. Their seeds ripen
during the following summer; they are brown, and nut-like, and the
pods will burst with a subdued “pop-pop” if taken into a warm room.</p>

<p>Found in June on sandy banks and dry pastures.</p>

<p>Its single leafy stalk, from 12 to 15 inches in height, is very
slightly hairy, and somewhat shining. It is pale in color, inclining to
dull pinkish.</p>

<p>The root-leaves are round at the tip, tapering to the base, and set
on long stems; the upper leaves are long, and narrow, with stem-like
bases; the margins are entire, the texture close and velvety to the
touch; in color dull green, the foot-leaves pinkish slightly. Set near
together, and alternately.</p>

<p>The 4 petals of the flower are heart-shaped, and spreading with a
shallow curve, of a thin texture, which shows the veins, and in color a
beautiful clear yellow; the calyx-tube is about a half-inch long, the
part which contains the seed-box is thick, grooved, and green, the upper
part is slender, and tinged with red: the 4 calyx-divisions are dry and
pale. The flowers are set in the angles of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Gray the blossoms of this plant which open in
early sunlight do not go to sleep until eleven o’clock at night. For a
space beneath the flowers the close-set leaves cease and the somewhat
curving stalk is bare.</p>

continuing until frost-time.</p>

<p>The stout and leafy stalk grows from 1 to 4 feet high; it is woody-fibred,
hairy, and light green in color.</p>

<p>The narrow, lance-shaped leaf tapers at each end, and has a strong
midrib, an irregular margin, and a very downy surface; in color green.
The upper leaves clasp the stalk by a stem-like base, the lower ones
with a strong, little foot-stem; they are alternately placed.</p>

<p>The 4 large heart-shaped petals, of a fine, thin texture, are a pure
light yellow color; the 8 stamens are orange-tipped, and the 4 divisions
of the calyx are pale yellow; they turn back upon its tube with a
twisting gesture. This calyx-tube is over an inch in length, the lower
half, which contains the seed-box, is enlarged, grooved, sticky to the
touch, and shining green; the upper part is slender, smooth, and not
sticky, and pale yellow in color. The flowers are set close on the stalk
in the hold of the leaves.</p>

<p>After its one night’s fragrant perfection, the withered blossom
hangs for a day or two, before its calyx-tube severs itself from the seed-box
as neatly as though cut by a knife. It is only by chance that the
clarity of the flower’s yellow hue is seen, when, in some gray morning
fog, a belated flower is caught full-blown. Sometimes the plant grows
to the size of a bush; its fall seedling shows a flat tuffet of curious,
white-marked lily-like leaves that hug the ground.</p>

it is round, and smooth, of a fine fibre, and inclined to red in color.</p>

<p>The long, narrow leaf has a general resemblance to that of the
willow; it is smooth, firm, and fine in texture, and of a cool dark
grayish-green color, and silvery beneath, with a light midrib. The
leaves are alternate on the stalk, without foot-stems.</p>

<p>The 4 rounded petals of the flower curve into a short foot, or claw,
at the base; they are of a fine and delicate texture, and a bright, clear
crimson-pink color; the 4 long, pointed divisions of the red-brown calyx

at the tip; the stamens 8. The flowers are poised on the top of the
slender, silky, violet-tinged pods, and arranged in a loose, long, and
curving spike, on the top of the stalk.</p>

<p>The plant gains its name of “Fire-weed” from its habit of springing
up on newly burned woodlands. Seen in the sunshine its coloring is
brilliant. Its long curving slender pods, bursting open lengthwise, set
free a mass of fine silky down, the wings of the tiny seeds.</p>

<p>Found in meadow grass lands, in May and June.</p>

<p>The sparingly branched stalk, from 2 to 3 feet high, is tough-fibred,
and smooth, though channeled with many fine grooves; it is
hollow, with an aromatic smell, and usually tends to a dull red color.</p>

<p>The 2- or 3-times divided leaf has narrow leaflets, tapering to the
tip, and sharply toothed on the edge; the surface is smooth, and the
texture firm; the color a strong, full-toned green. The leaves are few,
at long intervals, on short foot-stems that widen into a leafly membrane,
partly clasping the main stalk.</p>

<p>The minute yellow flower has 5 petals, turned in toward the
center; the stamens and pistil are small, and the calyx is of a pale
yellow-green color; the flowers grow in flat-topped clusters, from 2
to 3 inches broad, or larger.</p>

<p>In the hand, the Meadow Parsnip seems a little coarse in color and
texture, but its aspect is pleasing when seen lifting its bright yellow
green-ribbed parasols above the meadow grass.</p>

<p>Found in woods, and light shrubbery, in June.</p>

<p>The simple, sparingly branched stalk grows from 2 to 3 feet high,
and is round, smooth, slightly grooved, and hollow; it is green in color.</p>

<p>The leaf is deeply cut, or divided, from the base, (“palmate”) into
from 3 to 6 long-pointed divisions, sharply notched on the edge; in
color rather dark green. The leaves clasp the stalk by a very short,
leafy sheath, and appear clustered at the top, and alternate below, while
the root-leaves are on long stems.</p>

<p>The small, greenish-yellow flower has 5 petals with the tips turned
inward and tucked down into the center of the flower; under the petals
are concealed the stamens (which emerge at length, however). The
flowers are on very short foot-stems arranged in hemispherical heads,
three or four heads usually in a cluster, on the end of the stem. Two
kinds, stamen-bearing and pistil-bearing, are found in the same head;
the former dry up brown, while the latter develop burs armed with
little hooked spines.</p>

<p>Though the flower is not conspicuous in color, the plant claims
notice for its rather graceful, swaying gesture.</p>

<p>Found in moist rich grounds, often on the edge of shade, in blossom
in June.</p>

<p>The stalk grows very tall, sometimes 7 or 8 feet high; it is large,
round, and grooved—though not deeply so; it is hollow, with a strong
parsnip smell; and grass-green in color.</p>

<p>The leaf is compound, in three divisions, and large, the lower leaves
being sometimes a foot or more in length; each leaflet is more or less
deeply lobed, and sharply notched on the edge, and set on a short foot-stem;
the ribs are large, the upper surface almost smooth, while the
lower surface is soft and woolly; coarse in texture, and of a strong dark
green color. The main foot-stem of the leaf, widens into a leafy membrane
that partly clasps the stalk. The few large leaves are alternate.</p>

<p>The flower is small, and 5-petalled, the petals heart-shaped, or deeply
notched; the outer flowers are larger than the inner ones, and their
petals are quite unequal in size. In color white. They grow in wide
spreading, flat-topped clusters, sometimes 10 or 12 inches across.</p>

<p>On close approach the Cow Parsnip appears coarse in general make-up;
seen from a distance however it looks a plant of splendid swing

<p>A close observation will show that this may be found in blossom
in July, on moist, shady ground.</p>

<p>The weak-fibred, smooth, pale green stalk creeps over the ground,
and takes root, occasionally, at the joints.</p>

<p>It has a pretty, round, heart-shaped leaf, doubly scalloped on the
edge, and of a thin texture, with a smooth, shining surface; of a pale
green color. The leaves are alternate, on foot-stems about an inch long.</p>

<p>The minute white flowers are set close in the angles of the leaves
and are hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>The Pennywort grows gracefully amongst the grass in moist places.
One would hardly suspect, at a casual glance, that this weak-fibred vine
could belong to the same family with the mighty Cow Parsnip.</p>

<p>Found in roadside thickets, along meadow walls and fences, during
July and August.</p>

<p>The large, widely branching stalk reaches the height of 4 or 5 feet;
it is 4-, or occasionally 5-angled, very tough and woody-fibred, noticeably
grooved, and its surface is coarse; dull green.</p>

<p>The compound irregular leaf is large: the root-leaves are cut into
7 to 11 divisions, each part again cleft into 3 or 5 parts,—the upper
leaves are less compound; the leaflets are long oval, broadest at the
base, the margins closely notched, the texture thin, but coarse, the
surface smooth, the underside of the upper leaves shining. The color
is a dull dark green. The root-leaves are on long stems, while the
upper leaves are on shorter stems which clasp the stalk with wing-like
membranes; these are grooved, and large, their edges roll together, and
meet and lap about the stalk. The leaves are placed alternately, at
considerable intervals apart.</p>

<p>The tiny flowers are yellow, they spread flat, to show the undeveloped
seed-boxes, and are set on thread foot-stems in small, flat-topped,
round clusters; these, on long, up-curving stems, form a large spreading
cluster, upon a stout stem; they are terminal and from the angles
of the leaves; several of these large clusters occur on a plant.</p>

<p>“’Twill raise a blister, if you touch it when the dew’s on’t!”
says the farmer’s son. It has a strongly acrid odor when broken, a thing
which is well-nigh impossible to accomplish. The seeds, shining and
very flat discs, add to the decorative qualities of this conspicuous plant.</p>

<p>Very common by the wayside and in dry fields, blossoming from
July through September.</p>

<p>The round stalk, from 2 to 3 feet high, coarse in fibre, and
roughened by short hairs, is light yellow-green in color.</p>

<p>The leaf has a very fringy effect, being much cut up into long
narrow lobes; the surface is roughened; and the short foot-stem
widens into a leafy, clasping sheath. The yellowish-green, alternate
leaves are few, and far between.</p>

<p>The petal-like parts of the small clustered flowers are unequal in
size and number,—three or four of the outer flowers in each cluster are
larger than the rest; the color is white, with tiny yellow-tipped stamens.
The flowers have pale green foot-stems, and grow in flat-topped clusters,
each cluster being set around at the foot with a green leafy fringe. In
the center of the cluster is often found a single dark purple flower.</p>

<p>Though the growth is sprangly, and the stem coarse, yet the flower
is delicate with a lace-like quality. The seed-stems, curling inward,
form a hollow, nest-like cup, from which characteristic it is often called
the “Bird’s-nest plant.” It is deemed a great pest by farmers.</p>

<p>Found on moist hillsides, and along thickets, in May.</p>

<p>The root sends up one tall leaf-bearing stem, from 12 to 15 inches
in height, and beside it a short flower-stem.</p>

<p>The leaf is compound, sometimes doubly so, its leaflets long, oval,
and sharp-pointed at the tip, with noticeable ribs, finely notched margins,
and, when young, a very glossy surface; the foot-stems are 3, and
of equal length, forking from the summit of the round, hard-fibred,
shining stem. The leaf, when young, is strongly bronze-tinted; as it
matures this fades, and leaves it a pleasing light green color; the stem
is reddish at the joints, and near the foot.</p>

<p>The greenish-white flower is very small, its 5 petals are turned
down on the little calyx, and the 5 long stamens are erect and alternate
with them. The flowers are set on foot-stems in 3 flat-topped clusters,
that are borne on round stems forking from the top of the main flower-stem.</p>

<p>The bronzy hue of the leaves companions the unopened buds,—by
the time the flower-clusters are fully abloom the dark shining color has
changed to green, the leaflets have grown much larger, and spread like
a canopy ever the blossoms.</p>

August.</p>

<p>A widely branching plant, from 3 to 6 feet high, with a large,
strong, round stem; dull gray-black, not unlike willow charcoal in appearance.</p>

<p>The very large compound leaf is divided into 3 clusters, each one
of which has from 5 to 7 leaflets, on short, curved foot stems; the leaflets
are broad, of an irregular oblong shape, with a finely notched
margin, and a slightly downy surface. In color a strong full green;
with dark stems.</p>

<p>The very small flower has its parts in fives, and is greenish white;
the flowers are on pale foot-stems and arranged in little round clusters;
many small clusters together form the large compound group on the
ends of the branches, and from the angles of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>In September the plant ripens a small red berry, of a spicy, resinous
taste, agreeable to a confirmed wayfarer. The large joints are fitted
together with excellent workmanship. This striking plant, with its
wide-spreading, vigorous leafage, and dark stems, possesses highly
decorative qualities; it is cherished by country folk, however, for the
medicinal use they find for the root which is “good for a cough.”</p>

white woolly hairs; it is rose-colored, running into white. The corolla
sits on top of the little, round, green calyx, which develops into a large,
juicy, waxen white berry. The flowers and berries grow in a close
terminal spike, gradually weighed down by the enlarging berries.</p>

<p>Both berries and blossoms occur on the same spike. The Snowberry
was largely cultivated by our foremothers in their house yards,
and is still common about old houses.</p>

<p>Found in grassy meadows, pastures, and waysides during May;
generally in poor soil.</p>

<p>The slender, little, pale green flower-stems, from 2 to 6 inches in
height, sometimes branch, bear but few leaves, and rise from a foot-tuffet
of leaves.</p>

<p>These foot-leaves are very small, with little rounded tips, while the
stem-leaves are still smaller, long, narrow, and clasping in pairs. They
are entire, thin, and light green.</p>

<p>The flower has a tiny 4-parted, green calyx, and a tubular corolla
which spreads at the top into a 4-pointed star; very delicate in texture,
and varying from pure white to a deep china blue, with a dainty ring
of yellow in the center.</p>

<p>A very communistic plant is the Innocence, growing in great
patches along pasture fences and in meadow rifts and hollows, powdering
the greening slopes of early May with its many blossoms like a
belated spring snow-fall. Its buds droop, but the opened flowers lift
up their faces to reflect the sky; its calices hug the corollas, and after
they have fallen still guard the enlarged oval seed-boxes. It is not
unusual to find 3- or 5-pointed stars, and even 6- or 7-pointed variations
are occasionally discoverable. Tufts of seedlings found in the late
autumn will flower all winter, if well-potted and watered and given
plenty of fresh air.</p>

<p>Found in June, in dry woods, about the roots of pine trees.</p>

<p>This little running vine, 4 to 10 inches in length, is smooth and
slender, leafy and occasionally branching. In color, a pale green or
dark bronze-green.</p>

<p>The leaf is small, round-oval, widest at the base, thin but tough of
texture, with a smooth surface that shines when new-grown; the
margin is entire, and the midrib important. The young leaves are a
bright cool green, lighter underneath; the older growths become dark
and bluish green, the ribs and veins marking them with a light tracery.
The leaves, on short stems, are arranged in pairs.</p>

<p>The corolla, in the shape of a slender tube spreading into 4 points,
is covered thickly in the inside with cottony down, while the outside is
smooth; the color is creamy-white, the outside delicately tinted
creamy-pink. The little green calyx is 4-parted. The flowers bloom in pairs,
their seed-boxes united and set on a single stem, placed terminally.
The buds are pink.</p>

<p>Two kinds of flowers are borne on this plant, in one the 4 stamens
protrude from the tube and the pistil does not show, in the other the
2-parted pistil is very noticeable and the stamens are retired. The
delicious fragrance of the blossoms perfumes the whole woods where it
grows. The small oval berry with its two openings is loved by
children, because it is of a light coral-red color, and edible, though
rather tasteless.</p>

<p>Found on low, moist ground, and along borders of ponds, in June
and July.</p>

<p>A shrub from 3 to 5 feet high, with a stout, woody stem, covered
with a smooth reddish-brown bark.</p>

<p>The leaf, tapering at both ends, is 3 or 4 inches long, on a short
foot-stem; the surface is usually smooth, and the texture tough; of a
strong green color.</p>

<p>The small, tubular flower is 4-parted at the top, and of a dull,
white color. Many flowers are set together in a dense, round head,
with the pistils radiating in all directions. These sweet-scented flower-balls
grow on foot-stems, 2 or 3 inches long, in clusters of 3 to 5 or 7,
from the ends of the branches.</p>

<p>The Button-balls ripen in October, and are then noticeable among
the plentiful pods and berries of the season. They are dull red and
green in color, turning to a fine brown with the touch of frost. Picked
early in the season they make a pleasing addition to the pod-gatherer’s
winter collection.</p>

<p>Found in blossom through August and September, in moist or
swampy tangles and thickets.</p>

<p>The stalk is branching, but very weak-fibred, leaning on sturdier
plants for support, or lopping over; it is square, and closely set along
the angles with many minute downward-pointing prickles, by means of
which it clings or “cleaves” to its neighbors; color, a light green.</p>

<p>The small leaf is rounded at the tip, has an entire margin, and a
smooth upper surface; beneath, the edges and midrib are set with
prickles. The leaves grow in whorls of 4 or 6, close upon the stalk, at
regular intervals. The color is a pretty yellow-green.</p>

<p>The minute white corolla is 4-pointed, or occasionally 3-pointed,
with the same number of stamens; the calyx is green, and the foot-stems
are very small. The flowers grow in branching clusters from the
whorls of leaves.</p>

<p>Though a pretty plant growing, it is not a pickable one, as its
weak stems get themselves inextricably entangled and caught on their
own armor.</p>

<p>The short, leafy stalk, covered with a silvery wool, runs on the
ground, and is from 3 to 10 inches in height. Pale green in color.</p>

<p>The small, broad-oval leaf is rounded at the tip, 3-ribbed, of a
tough fibre, and, when young, covered with a silky white wool. It is
set on a short, margined stem. In color, light grayish-green.</p>

<p>The flowers are gathered in small heads,—the stamen-bearing and
pistil-bearing flowers growing on different plants. The pistil-bearing
heads are like little bundles of silky threads, silvery white; the stamen-bearing
heads are more rounded in shape, and of a creamy-white color,
the tawny stamens being tipped with orange. The heads are set in pale
green, urn-shaped, small cups, on short foot-stems, forming a little group
on the top of the flower-stem.</p>

<p>Spring Everlasting spreads rapidly by runners sent out from the

grassy road.</p>

<p>The leaves, and the flowers on stems which vary from 3 or 4 to 12
inches in height, rise from the root.</p>

<p>The long and narrow leaf is often and irregularly cut, the notches
generally pointing backwards, and the margin is also sharply toothed;
the texture is close, the surface is smooth, and the midrib is wide; the
edge is wavy. In color, grass green, the midrib pale. Many leaves grow
in a rosette-like cluster from the root,—the flower buds held in the
center.</p>

<p>The small “strap-shaped” flowers, with their notched ends, are
gathered in overlapping rows, to form a large circular head; in color
they are a brilliant orange-yellow, the central flowers deeper in tint.
The head is confined in a cup of many narrow, dark green, leafy bracts,
and set on long, smooth, elastic stems, which are hollow, and juicy with
a bitter-flavored milk.</p>

<p>The seed-globe of the Dandelion is a favorite with children, by
whom it is named a “clock”; its seeds are furnished with feathery
plumes, which serve as wings to waft them abroad. The flower-stem
too is easily split when plucked, and curls into enchanting spirals that
no youthful taste may resist. When cut off short by the cruel lawn-mower,
these generous plants put forth fresh golden discs close to the
ground within the leaves.</p>

<p>Found in moist meadows, on banks, and brooksides in May.</p>

<p>The flowers and leaves grow from the root, about 4 or 6 inches high.</p>

<p>The leaf appears some time after the flowers; it is large, rounding,
with a heart-shaped base, the margin slightly broken by small rounded
points, and with strong ribs radiating from the base; it is exceptionally
fine in texture, and the upper side is possessed of a silky smoothness,
the lower side being soft woolly (the new leaves are very woolly). They
grow from the root on stout, half-round stems, that are dull purplish-red
in color, and often covered with a loose white wool; the leaves are
a fine cool green, silvery beneath.</p>

<p>The small flowers are grouped in dandelion-like heads, with many
fine fringy rays; all colored alike a bright yellow. The head is held
in a deep, leafy cup that is green strongly tinged with reddish-brown;
it grows on a stout, grooved, roughish stem, which bears several, small,
brownish scales; it rises from the ground before the leaves.</p>

<p>The Coltsfoot, introduced from England, has become thoroughly
naturalized here. Its blossoms bear a certain superficial resemblance to
the Dandelion, though really different in habits of growth. The leaves
are truly decorative, growing thickly in large spaces, and forming a
mosaic of green tiles close down to the brook’s edge.</p>

<p>The stalk (from 8 to 18 inches high) is single, and sparingly leafy;
grooved, and slightly hairy. Color, light green.</p>

<p>The long, narrow leaf, with a tapering tip, and a partly-clasping
base, has a taut midrib which fulls the blade; its margin is sparsely
notched (except that of the upper leaves), and the surface is slightly
hairy. The color is green, with a paler midrib. The arrangement is
alternate, and at long intervals.</p>

<p>The disc flowers are very small, and in color greenish-yellow; set
in a flat-topped head, surrounded by many long rays, like a finely cut
fringe, which are blue or pinkish-lavender. The cup is hemispherical,
and green. The heads form a flat-topped terminal cluster.</p>

<p>Robin’s Plantain grows in communities among tall grasses, swaying
gracefully on its long stalks as the breeze sweeps over the field. This
is apparently the only one of its class that is distinguished by an

light green.</p>

<p>The root-leaves are very long, the others decrease in size as they
mount the stalk; they are long and narrow, with sparsely and irregularly
notched margins (sometimes only one to a leaf), and a firm texture,—smooth
to the touch. The color is green. They clasp the stalk
partly, and occur alternately.</p>

<p>The disc flowers form a small flat button, which is at first greenish,
and later changes to yellowish-orange; the rays are many, fine and
fringy in appearance, and varying in color from white to pink. The
cup is light green. The flower heads grow in somewhat flat-topped
clusters on the top of the stalk, upon limber stems which are inclined
to droop.</p>

<p>This Fleabane follows Robin’s Plantain in the succession of June

<p>This is a plant of communal habit, and profusely flowering. It has
a trick of folding down its rays at night, and is a great sluggard about
spreading them in the morning. After the rays age and fall, the disc
becomes cone-shaped. “It has taken up its place by the roadside, close
to the ruts—in bad taste.” (Thoreau’s Journal for June 25, 1852.)</p>

<p>Found in June in the shade of dry woods, or on barren hilltops
and pastures.</p>

<p>The flower-stem springs from a rosette of foot-leaves; it grows
from 1 to 2 feet high, bears but one leaf midway, and is smooth and
shining. Of a light green color, with flecks of crimson at the leaf, and
near the foot.</p>

<p>The foot-leaf is large (from 1 to 3 inches long), a long oval with a
pointed tip, the midrib is wide, flat, and hairy, the prolonged base, or
short stem, is partly clasping; the margin is entire and fringed with
gray hairs, the texture is leathery. In color a dull light green, while
the edge, ribs, and underside are red-purple. The single leaf on the
flower-stem is long, narrow, and smooth; of a dull green color.</p>

<p>The flower is like a ribbon (or “strap-shaped”) with a finely
notched tip; of fine texture, and smooth. The color is a bright Dandelion
yellow. 20 or more of these flowers are arranged in a spreading
head, enclosed in a leafy light green cup, whose tips are tawny-red.
The heads are set on long, slender stems, which fork from the main
stem, with a tiny leaf sitting at the point of junction.</p>

<p>This jaunty plant, though found in the open, likes also the shade,
where yet it never fails to swing its yellow heads out towards the sunshine.
Sometimes the foot-leaves are wanting, and the flower-stem
rises from the bare ground.</p>

<p>Found, during August and September, growing along roads and
thickets in dry shade.</p>

<p>The stalk, which grows to 2 or 3 feet high, is simple at first, but
branches above, and is leafy; it is round, hard-fibred, smooth—but
downy near the flowers. In color a light green, pale near the foot.</p>

<p>The leaf is a long lance shape, pointed at the tip and broad at the
base, with a prominent strong midrib, the margin sparingly and sharply
toothed; of a firm texture, and smooth. The color is a medium green,
silvery underneath, the midrib light. It is set close upon the stalk,
slightly clasping it; the arrangement is alternate. The length of the
lowest leaves (sometimes 4 inches) decreases gradually, to that of a
tiny thread at the spring of the flower-stems.</p>

<p>The flowers are finely notched at the tip; of a bright pure yellow
color. The noticeably protruding two-tipped pistil is tawny-gray. The
flower-head is large and spreading; its green cup is smooth and close-folded.
The heads, on slender, downy, green stems, each of which bears
a single leaf, are arranged in a loose terminal cluster.</p>

<p>Like all the Hawkweeds the Canada loves not solitude, but grows
in gay encampment along a shaded road, where travellers welcome its
strong absolute yellow, that is yet tempered to pleasing softness of tint
by the many little gray pistils.</p>

<p>Found in June, in open fields and roadways.</p>

<p>The flower-stem rises from a rosette of foot-leaves; it bears one or
two leaves near the-ground, is slender, round, grooved, and hairy. The
hairs are dark enough to somewhat obscure the green color of the stem.</p>

<p>The leaf is long oval, with an irregular margin, and strong midrib;
the texture is coarse, and both upper and under surfaces are covered
by long gray hairs. The color is green, with a lighter midrib. One or
two leaves occur upon the flower-stems,—they are smaller than the
others.</p>

<p>The tip of the slender “strap-shaped” flower is more finely fringed
than is usual with the Hawkweeds. In color an orange-red, or tawny,
rather dark in hue, while the pistil is bright yellow. The cup is green,
with many dark tawny hairs. The heads are set on short stems in a
terminal cluster.</p>

<p>This is the flower commonly known in England by the folk-name
of “Grim the Collier,” because of the dark and hairy aspect of its
blossoms; the hairs near the flower-heads are of noticeable length and
modify their color perceptibly. It is to be noted that the heads are
composed of fewer colors than most of the common Hawkweeds. The
plumy seeds are of a yellow-gray color and very pretty. Although the
botanical calendar places the flowering time of the Tawny in June,
personal observation has only noted it in the autumn; during middle
September it is to be found in full bloom in northern Vermont.</p>

<p>The stalk branches only for the flowers, and varies from 12 to 16
inches in height; it is round, and slender, roughened by short small
hairs, and is somewhat zigzag in manner of growth. Of a green or
reddish-purple color.</p>

<p>The leaf is oval, pointed at both ends, with an entire margin, and
strong midrib; both surfaces are rough and woolly. The color is
green. The lower leaves are sometimes 4 inches in length, and narrow.
The leaves are set immediately upon the stem, at long intervals.</p>

<p>The flowers are slightly notched at the tip. A strong yellow color.
The cup is vase-shaped, hairy; and green. The heads are set on
slender, rough-hairy stems, and arranged in a terminal cluster; a small
leaf occurs at the junction of the stems.</p>

<p>The blossoms open only in the broad sunlight, and when plucked
wilt quickly, thus losing their chief charm, a jaunty carriage.</p>

<p>Found on waysides, and edges of thickets, in July.</p>

<p>The simple leafy stalk grows to be 3 or 4 or 5 feet high; it is
hollow, and large, with a strong fibre, a thick, milky and bitter juice,
and a tough skin whose surface is somewhat hairy. The color is
usually a dark purplish-red.</p>

<p>The long leaf is deeply cut, or lobed, even almost to the wide
midrib,—the lobes pointing toward the base of the leaf,—the tip taper-pointed;
the upper leaves are slightly or not at all lobed; the surface
is smooth above, sometimes hairy on the underside of the midrib. The
arrangement is alternate, the leaves partly clasping the stalk. In color
a full green, the midrib of the lower leaves a dark reddish-purple.</p>

<p>The minute flowers are collected in small heads, set in vase-shaped
green cups; their color varies from a light, dull lavender, to a dingy
white. The heads grow in branching clusters from the summit of the
stalk.</p>

<p>The stout, tall, dark red stalk and broadly veined leaves make
this a conspicuous inhabitant of the roadside; its small flowers however
do not seem to fulfil the promise put forth by this vigorous growth.
The dark brown, flattened seeds have fine, white, dandelion-like plumes.</p>

<p>The stalk grows from 2 to 3 feet high, and is branching, and
shrubby; its fibre is strong, it is slightly grooved, and silky to the
touch. In color silvery green.</p>

<p>The rather small leaf is often divided to the midrib, the divisions
being long and narrow; the surface is smooth, with fine silky hairs.
Color, silvery green. The leaves are set upon the stalk in clusters, alternately;
they have an aromatic scent.</p>

<p>The flowers are very minute, of a pale yellowish-green color, and
clustered in small hemispherical heads, in pale green cups; their heads,
nodding along the sides of the slender branchlets, form long terminal
spires.</p>

<p>This Artemisia, though escaped from the garden, has taken most
kindly and naturally to the common road, where its light silvery sheen
renders it quite distinct from the surrounding growths. It has an agreeable
pungent odor, resembling that of the Chrysanthemum, though much
stronger, and it is very bitter to the taste.</p>

<p>Found in July and August, chiefly along walls and fences, although
occasionally in fields.</p>

<p>The stout and sturdy stalk, which grows to be sometimes 4 feet
high, is branching and leafy, tough-fibred, round and smooth. Of a
rich, light green color.</p>

<p>The large and long leaf is so deeply cleft into many narrow, oblong
divisions, and the margin is so regularly toothed, that it bears the appearance
of a curly feather; the vigorous curving midrib is an important
feature; its texture is coarse, and it is pungently odorous. The color
is a full, rich, dark green.</p>

<p>The flowers are very small, of a strong, full yellow, tending slightly
toward green; packed tightly into a flat head, like a button with a little
dent in the middle. The heads, enclosed in a shallow, yellow-green
leafy cup, are set on slender, light green stems, and arranged in large,
loose terminal clusters.</p>

<p>Growing in thickly-settled communities the Tansy plant forms a
well known member of the roadside tenantry with its noble dark foliage,
luxuriant and usually free from blight, and strong stalks topped profusely
by the flower clusters, whose yellow is toned to a remarkable
harmony with green. On a hot day the smell of the Tansy may be perceived
at a considerable distance. “In the spring time are made with
the leaves hereof, newly sprung up, and with eggs, cakes or Tansies,
which be pleasant in taste, and goode for the stomacke,” says Gerarde,
and echoes of rules for Tansy-cakes come to us from the records of early
New England house-wives.</p>

<p>The stalk (from 1 to 2 feet high) is very erect, sometimes bears
branches, and is sparingly leafy; it is strong-fibred, coarse-textured, and
hairy. The color, light green, is often brownish near the foot.</p>

<p>The leaf is long and narrow, with a fine-pointed tip, and an entire
margin; the texture is loose, and the surface rough. The color is yellow-green.
It slightly clasps the stalk. The leaves are arranged sparsely
and alternately.</p>

<p>The minute flowers, of a rich, deep purple-brown color, are packed
smoothly and closely in a cone-shaped head, the base of which is
surrounded by a single row of 12 or 15 rays; these rays are over an inch
long, and are sometimes one-half wide, they are blunt-pointed with a
notched top, their texture is silken and faintly shows the veins, and
their color is of a noble full yellow. The head is set upon a mat made
of a double row of overlapping, small, green parts, and is borne singly
on the summit of the stalk, or branch.</p>

<p>A ruthless invader of mowing lots where it makes a brilliant patch
of color that may be discerned from afar, the farmer wages war on this
handsome flower. It is not unusual to find it indulging in odd variations
upon the established habit of blossoming, such as doubling the
rows of rays, or with two or three heads bunched together, or set atop
of one another.</p>

<p>The leaf is lance-shaped, with a long fine-pointed tip, and united
at the base to the opposite leaf, completely encircling the stalk as
though strung upon it; the margin is finely notched, the midrib stout,
with many veins showing; the upper surface is rough, the underside is
hairy. The color is a strong green. The pairs of leaves are set at right
angles with each other, and at a considerable space apart.</p>

<p>The flowers are small and feathery; greenish white. They are
gathered in small tuft-like heads, and arranged in loose, leafy, terminal
clusters, on short, stout, pale stems.</p>

<p>A charming kink in the outline marks the joining of the leaves.
The pleasant perfume of the blossoms is proclaimed by the frequent
visits of the bees. Sometimes the flower-cluster spreads to an unexpected
size; personal measurement has discovered a plant, but 18
inches in height, whose clustered bloom was fully a foot across.</p>

<p>The leaf is large, broadly oval, taper-pointed, and widest at the

smooth surface. The leaves are set on short stems, and are placed opposite
each other on the stalk. The color is green.</p>

<p>The minute flowers, and projecting pistils, are white; and grouped
in small heads, enclosed in vase-shaped cups of green, on short stems.
The heads are arranged in close, rather flat-topped clusters on the top

<p>This plant comes into bloom in company with its next of kin, Joe
Pye and Boneset; it thrives well under cultivation, and certainly is
worthy of a better name than “Snake-root,”—which is, perhaps, the
reason it is so generally known by “Eupatorium,” the generic name it
shares with so many others. It is much frequented by some small
creature who leaves a pale labyrinthine trail etched on the broad surface
of its leaves.</p>

clusters.</p>

<p>Joe Pye is a striking plant, of vigorous growth, whose large whorls

<p>The branching, leafy stalk is 1 or 2 feet high; large, round, and
tough-fibred; covered with white wool. In color, green.</p>

<p>The leaf is long, and narrow, tapering to a long point, with a large,
stout, and curling midrib; the margin is deeply, and often cut, and
armed at every point by strong, stiff, thorn-like spines. The texture is
tough, and the upper surface is prickly, while the under is woolly with
web-like hairs. The leaf clasps the stalk, and hugs it for a full inch or
more before it springs away with a free curve; the lobes are ruffled, and
flaring, as they lie along the stalk. The arrangement is alternate, and
rather near together. The color is green, lighter at the midrib.</p>

<p>The flowers are small and silky; in color a beautiful deep crimson,
tending toward violet. Many flowers are gathered into a large round-topped
head, that is held in an admirably shaped green cup, which is
protected by many, long, needle-pointed, white spines. One or two
flower-heads occur together on the summit of the stalk, or branch. Their
perfume is delicious.</p>

<p>This might well be named the Warrior Thistle, being armed <i lang="fr">cap-a-pie</i>
for conflict with cows and boys, and nearly impregnable against
them. It loves to sit beside a boulder in the midst of cow-path, or bye-lane,
and defy intercourse with any, save the bumble-bees, who sleep
upon the silken flower o’ nights. Special observation should be given
to the classic vase-shape of the cup.</p>

with short, sharp spines; the strong midrib is lighter in color than the
grayish-green leaf. The leaves, set immediately upon the stalk, are
alternately placed.</p>

<p>The small tubular flowers are 5-pointed, and the thread-like stamens
and pistils are prominent; their color is lavender, while the stamens and
pistils are white. They are gathered into tufted heads, enclosed in a
gray-green vase-shaped cup, that is protected by short weak prickles;
they grow in loose, branching clusters on the top of the plant.</p>

<p>This Thistle grows in great communities, spreading rapidly, and
justly considered a pest by the farmer. The mass of its lavender
colored bloom in its prime is pleasing to the eye, but later it develops
an unkempt and weedy aspect, more befitting its character of an
unwelcome tramp. Its flowers are sweet scented, and much sought by
bees and butterflies.</p>

<p>Found in cultivated fields, and along roadsides, in August.</p>

<p>The stalk is either simple, or branching near the top, from 2 to 3
or 4 feet high, large, round, and very hollow like a tube, and juicy; it
is grooved, and smooth to the touch. The color is green, sometimes
streaked with red near the foot.</p>

<p>The leaf is very long (sometimes 10 inches), lance-shaped with a
tapering point, and noticeable rounded wing-like bases; the margin is
deeply and irregularly toothed, and the edge is rolled under, thus
making the teeth sharp-pointed, and stiff, like little spines; the midrib
is prominent beneath, wide, flat, and pale above; underneath many
veins show; the texture is thin, and the surface is smooth. The upper
side is a cool clear green, the underside silvery, with a pale bloom. It
is clasping, the prolonged bases flaring like wings on either side of the
stalk.</p>

<p>The flowers are tiny and downy; light yellow in color; gathered
in a flat-topped head (which is less than an inch across), enclosed in a
small vase-shaped, green, and leafy cup. The heads are set on slender
stems, in loose terminal groups, or singly on short leafy stems from the
angles of the leaves; at the junction of these foot-stems small, oval
leaves occur.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more suggestive of decorative design than the
fine arch and spring of this leaf, with its ornamental winged clasps;
and its refinement of color is an added excellence. The highly inappropriate
folk-name (it is said to be a favorite article of diet among
the English swine) should be abolished, and the plant called instead
The Gothic Thistle in memory of a school who could appreciate its
sculptural significance better than the moderns.</p>

<p>Found in fields, and cultivated lands in August.</p>

<p>The stalk varies in height from 1 to 4 feet; it is single, and leafy,
somewhat twisting, tougher in fibre than <i lang="la">S. asper</i>, hollow, with a milky
juice, and smooth. Color, a cool green.</p>

<p>The curiously cut leaf (about 6 inches long) is divided into a large
triangular tip, a pair of acute-angled flaring side divisions, and narrow
long-pointed bases which project like sharp-pointed wings beyond the
stalk they clasp. Occasional leaves are not cut, and are merely lance-shaped.
The midrib is flat above, and round beneath; the margin is
toothed, with fine, weak spines; the texture is firm, and the surface is
smooth and shining. Color, a fine cool green, the underside silvery
with bloom. The arrangement is alternate.</p>

<p>The flowers are similar in color, size, and arrangement to <i lang="la">S. asper</i>.
The foot-stems are sometimes bristly with short hairs, and at their
junction occurs a long-pointed, small leaf, whose margin is entire.
Below the flower-cluster the stalk is bare for a considerable space;
single flower-heads spring from the angles of the leaves the greater part
of its height.</p>

<p>The immature flower-heads are wrapped in a woolly blanket. The
leaf is something like a Dandelion’s in shape, and interesting from a
decorative point of view. These plants are said to be common to many
countries,—Europe, Africa, and New Zealand. In the last-named
region an old traveller says the parrots “of beauteous dyes, but odious
accents” feed upon it.</p>

<p>Found, from July to September, growing in dry waste places.</p>

<p>The stalk, which varies from 2 to 4 feet in height, is branching,
and leafy, rather large, stout and tough of fibre, and rigid in growth;
it is grooved and hairy. The color is gray-green.</p>

<p>The leaf is not large, oblong in shape, with a sharp tip; the margin
is slightly notched, with spreading hairs along the edge; the midrib is
strong and the surface is hairy; the gesture curving, or wavy. In
color, gray-green. The lower leaves are sharply cut at the base. The
arrangement is alternate, and the leaves clasp the stalk.</p>

<p>The flower is “strap-shaped,” rather broad, with a finely notched
lip; the texture is very fine and thin, and the surface is shining and
smooth. The color is an exquisite gray-blue or lavender, sometimes inclining
to lilac, or even to pink. The flowers are arranged in heads,
composed of several rows, spreading from a leafy green cup, which is
closely surrounded by 4 or 6 little leaves (or “bracts”): all these parts
being hairy. The heads are set close to the stalk in groups of twos and
threes, in the angles of leaves, or singly on short stout stems.</p>

<p>These charmingly colored blossoms are scattered all along the stalks
and branches, beginning near the foot, where they first open, not more
than a few being in perfection at once. This scantiness of bloom and
the stiff weediness of its growth make the Chicory plant less loved than
it deserves for the peculiar beauty of its blue flowers. It grows most
profusely near the seaboard, and in vacant city lots or neglected door-yards
it bravely tries to hide the ugly remnants of civilization thrown
aside by man.</p>

<p>Found, during August and September, along roads and in barren
fields.</p>

<p>The stalk branches much, and is very leafy, with a bushy habit of
growth, between 2 and 4 feet in height; it is large, stout-fibred, round,
grooved, and rough to the touch. The color is light green, showing the
red-purple tints of the flowers in streaks, especially at the junction of
the stems.</p>

<p>The leaf is very large; the foot-leaves (often over 12 inches long)
are rudely heart-shaped, and much puckered or fulled on the midrib,
the upper leaves are smaller, and oval; the ribs show underneath in
bold relief, the veins being like a strong network; the margin is entire,
the texture coarse, and the surface rough. The color is gray-green,
lighter underneath, while the midrib is pink above, and paler beneath.
The leaves are set on stout, trough-like, reddish stems, which clasp the
stalk; the arrangement is alternate.</p>

<p>The flower is very small and silky, crowded into a soft tuft, enclosed
in an urn-shaped burr, which is armed with row upon row of
sharp out-spreading spines, long, hooked, and sticky. The color of the
heads varies, from nearly white, to a deep rose-purple, or blue-purple;
the burr is green, or purple. The heads are set on short stems in irregular
terminal groups, or on the short branches.</p>

<p>As the flowers mature thread-like white pistils push forth; they
open first on the rim of the head. Ranking a pest among flowers, the
Burdock is loved by children for its sticky burrs from which they
fashion variegated toys. Designers would do well to study its bold
finely arching leaves. “So if you please we will take a leaf of burdock,
the principal business of that plant being clearly to grow leaves, wherewith
to adorn foregrounds.”—-Ruskin.</p>

<p>Found along roadsides in August.</p>

<p>Growing to the good height of 5 feet sometimes, this very large,
and stout stalk is single and leafy, tough-fibred, but smooth to the
touch. Colored green, with a beautiful purple-gray bloom.</p>

<p>The leaf is large; its heart-shaped base has prolonged points, and
its tip tapers very much; the margin is irregularly scalloped, its ribs
are many and strong, the midrib being large and prominent beneath,
and so taut it puckers and pulls the blade; the texture is thick, and the
underside is slightly woolly. The root-leaves are oval, and on long
stems; the upper leaves are clasping, and alternately placed. Their
color is a strong grayish-green, of a peculiarly fine, cool quality.</p>

<p>The flowers are small, and yellow, soon turning to tawny. They
are set in a large disc, surrounded by many, narrow, bright yellow rays.
The cup which holds the head is shallow and composed of many broad,
curling or wavy, light green parts, which overlap each other in several
rows; close beneath the cup occurs a small leaf. The head is set on a
stem which bears a single leaf midway its length; two or three flower-heads
are grouped together; they are placed terminally, and in the
angles of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>Growing in large settlements, by the stone wall or Virginia-rail
fence, Elecampane commands attention by its splendid vigor of growth,
and the free curves of its fine leafage. In color too, it is highly suggestive
of decorative purposes, for the excellence of its green, and the plum-gray
bloom upon its stout stalk.</p>

<p>Found in July, August, and September, in roadside tangles, dry
pastures and uplands.</p>

<p>The stalk which varies from 12 to 18 inches in height is branching,
and leafy, round, woody-fibred, and covered with silky wool. Of a
light green color, much modified by the gray-white wool, which is often
tinged with brown near the ground.</p>

<p>The leaf is very long and narrow, with a pointed tip, the midrib is
noticeably strong, and the margin entire; it is soft and agreeable to the
touch, because of the silky wool which covers both upper and lower
surfaces, and tempers its color to a light gray-green, somewhat darker
than the stalk. The arrangement is clasping, alternate, and frequent.</p>

<p>The flower is very small and fuzzy; yellow, or tawny-brown, according
to the stage of its maturity; it is arranged in small tufts,
enclosed by many rows of tiny, dry, gray-white sheath-like husks, that
enfold and guard it closely. The head is set on a short, downy, white
foot-stem. Several (4 to 12) heads are gathered together upon a longer
stem, and a few, or many, of these groups are arranged in a loose terminal
cluster. Sometimes these clusters are very large,—measuring 6,
or even 8 inches across.</p>

<p>A peculiar dry odorousness pervades the blossoms, and forms an
essential feature of the charm this Everlasting possesses for its friends,
a charm as undefinable as that which abides in the New England
pastures, where it loves to dwell in thrifty fellowship with the Hardhack
and Huckleberry bushes.</p>

<p>The stalk, which is very erect in bearing, grows to be about 2 feet
high usually; it is single, or branches near the top, and leafy; of a
stout fibre difficult to pluck, round and grooved, and covered with
wool which causes the green color to look whitish.</p>

<p>The leaf is long and narrow, deeply and finely cut into slender
line-like divisions, these being also cleft 3 or 5 times which gives it a
fringy appearance; with a strong midrib, and covered with white wool
on the underside. The color is gray-green. It is clasping, and the
arrangement is alternate, and often crowded into little tufts along the
stems.</p>

<p>The flower is very small; pale brown, or bright cheese-colored
yellow; crowded into a small thimble-topped head, and surrounded by
3 to 5 small, oblong, white rays, with finely notched tips. The head is
held in a deep, pale green, or nearly white, cup, and set on a slender,
leafy, white, or pale green stem. The heads are arranged in terminal
clusters.</p>

<p>Generally the flower-cluster is noticeably flat-topped, even the
small groups of the side branches strive to reach a uniform level with
the central cluster. A friar-like gravity of hue shows this plant to be
a typical New Englander, thriving with sturdy content on sterile soil,
and sending forth a wholesome aromatic odor. In certain localities the
rays are tinted pink, almost crimson.</p>

or frequently a dark, rich, purplish-red, with a bloom upon it.</p>

<p>The leaves are variable in shape and size; the root-leaves are large,
often and deeply cleft, and set on a 3- to 5-inch stem; the lower leaves
of the stalk are broad, faintly notched or 3-cleft; while the upper leaves

colored also. A few small bracts occur at the base of the flower-head,
which droops on a small stem. The heads are arranged in little clusters

firm-fibred, and smooth. Green in color.</p>

<p>The root-leaves are large (2 or 3 inches in length), wedge-shaped,
or 3- to 5-divided; the upper leaves are smaller, varying from a wedge
or heart-shape to a long-pointed oval. They all have entire, or faintly
notched margins, and the midribs, shining above, are rough beneath.
They are set on stems, which are sometimes provided with narrow
spreading margins; the <span class="cor" title="Source: arrangment" id="cor310">arrangement</span> is alternate, with a certain interval

<p>The flower is small, “strap-shaped,” with a square notched tip;
cream-white in color. 5 or 6 are included in a tubular cup, composed of
a close-folded row of narrow, green or purplish, pale, leafy parts; these
cups are set nodding on slight foot-stems, and arranged in small irregular
groups, on short branches, which form a long, irregularly arranged
terminal spike.</p>

<p>The blossoms are so small they are quite out of proportion to the
height and strength of the stalk; their habit is scattering, and only a
few heads open at the same time. The plant is most effective when all
its stiff little downy seeds are spreading themselves for flight.</p>

<p>Found through September and October, in cultivated fields, and
along thicket borders.</p>

<p>The stalk branches for flowers near the top; it is leafy, large, from
3 to 7 or 8 feet, very stout, and rough with short hairs. Its color is
light green.</p>

<p>The leaf is large, and oval, with a pointed tip and widest at the
base, where it tapers into a short stem; the margin is somewhat obscurely
notched, the texture is coarse, showing 3 strong ribs, and the
surface is rough. The color is a full, strong green. In growth, the
leaves are generally opposite, though the upper leaves are often
alternate.</p>

<p>The disc flowers are small, tubular, and 5-pointed, of a dull yellow
color; the stamens are protruding, spirally curled, and brownish; the
rays, from 8 to 15 in number, are long, and broad, and colored a
brilliant orange-yellow. The leafy cup, which encloses the head, is
composed of several rows of green parts; the heads grow singly from
the summit of the stalk, or by twos and threes, on stems, from the
angles of the leaves. This is a towering plant, whose brilliant flowers
and vigorous leafage render it an effective feature of the wild hedgerow.
Its tuberous root is sometimes cooked as a vegetable, and in a
raw state is eaten by men and boys.</p>

<p>The stalk reaches about 3 feet in height; it is leafy, and branching
widely, slender, and rough to the touch. Color, green.</p>

<p>The leaf is like a grass blade, very narrow and long, pointed at
both ends, with an entire margin, and parallel veins; the texture is
thin, the edge and midrib slightly rough. In color gray-green.</p>

<p>The disc flowers are few, the ray flowers very short, from 10 to 18
in number. The heads are arranged in small flat-topped clusters.</p>

<p>The branches are so nicely graduated in length that they form a
large-topped flowery summit to the slender stalk, the buds opening in
the center first. The green is tempered to a more perfect harmony
with the yellow bloom than is usual among the Goldenrods, and the cup
is of so yellow a hue it scarcely shows a trace of green.</p>

and rough to the touch; 1 or 2 feet <span class="cor" title="Source: high" id="cor320">high.</span> Green.</p>

<p>The leaf is narrow, and tapering to a point at both ends, with a
sharp tip. The margin of the lower leaves is notched, the upper leaves
are entire. They sit close upon the stalk in alternate arrangement.
The color is a homely green.</p>

<p>The rays are from 4 to 12 in number; and cream colored, like the
disc flowers. The small heads are gathered in crowded groups, set in
the angles of the small, pale, upper leaves, forming a long club-shaped
spike.</p>

<p>Sometimes the plant is slightly hairy, and occasionally the lower
leaves are oval in shape, and furnished with stems. The bloom begins
at the tip of the spike, whose gesture deserves the name of “rod”
more nearly than its more graceful sisters. If not well-nourished the
blossoms are apt to be ragged, and dingy in color.</p>

<p>An odor of camphor mingles with the sweet scent of these flowers,
and is distinctly perceptible at a distance. The decorative quality of
the leafage is of unique excellence.</p>

<p>Found chiefly on the edges of pine woods in September.</p>

<p>The stalk reaches from 1 to 2 feet in height; it is single, leafy,
slender, and rough to the touch. In color, pale green, tinged with red.</p>

<p>The leaf is long, and narrow, with an entire margin; the surface
covered with a minute down that is harsh to the touch; the fibre is stiff.
The color is green. The leaves are set upon the stalk, irregularly,
alternating, and numerous.</p>

<p>The disc flowers are yellow; the ray flowers, 12 to 20 in number,
are long and slender, and pale bluish-lavender in color. The heads are
few, and grow, on slender stems, either singly, or in a terminal flat-topped
cluster.</p>

<p>The stiff edges of the leaves and their rigid bearing are not unlike
the needles which carpet the favorite haunts this Aster loves. Though
not pleasant to pluck, on account of its harsh texture, this is a very
attractive plant to look upon.</p>

<p>The slender, branching stalk (2 to 3 feet high) is soft, with down,
to the touch. Light green in color. Leaning and swaying in gesture.</p>

<p>The leaves are very variable in shape, the lowest being decidedly
heart-shaped, and set on long margined stems (these margins somewhat
notched) that clasp the stalk with shallow wings; above, the leaves are
somewhat heart-shaped, and are set on short stems, that clasp the stalk
with broad wings; while the upper leaves are set immediately upon the
stalk, and clasp it by their prolonged bases. All the leaves have tapering
tips, entire, or very slightly, notched margins, with a rough upper
surface, while underneath it they are soft-hairy to the touch; they are
placed alternately. The color is cool green.</p>

<p>The disc flowers are pale yellow at first, but become reddish-brown
in maturity. The ray flowers, 10 to 20 in number, are pale lavender or
lilac. The heads are arranged in loose clusters.</p>

<p>The color of this leafage, and its shapes, are very pleasing. Gray’s
<cite>Manual</cite> states the color of its rays as “bright blue”!</p>

dry banks.</p>

<p>The stalk is often about 4 feet high, very widely branching, leafy,
and bearing a profusion of flowers; it has a coarse, very rough surface
usually. In color reddish.</p>

<p>The leaf has a heart-shaped base, and pointed tip, a slightly notched
or entire margin, and a coarse texture, the surface generally being rough
above and also on the underside of the midrib; the upper leaves clasp
the stalk, while the lower, and larger, leaves are set on short hairy stems.
In color, a rather dull green. They are numerous all the way from
foot to tip.</p>

<p>The many flower-heads, are small, with 14 to 20 delicate, short, pale-lavender
rays; the cups are smooth and shining, and are set on leafy
foot-stems, in large loose clusters.</p>

<p>Coming just as its purple and white sisters are departing, and as
though desiring to atone for their cessation, this delightful late Aster
fills the country roads and lanes with the generous abundance of its
misty gray-lavender bloom.</p>

<p>The single, very erect stalk varies from 1 to 2 feet in height, and
is very slender, grooved, and noticeably twisted; its fibre is fine, and
near the foot it is hairy to the touch. In color green, with a trace of
red at the leaf.</p>

<p>The foot-leaves are large, and a wide oval in shape, and set on
margined stems; the upper leaves are a long narrow, oval shape, diminishing
in size to a mere line, and are set immediately upon the stalk;
the margins are irregularly notched, they are downy to the touch, and
light green, tending to yellow. Their arrangement is alternate.</p>

<p>The small flower is 2-lipped, the lower lip being 3-parted with a
pair of swellings at the throat of the tube, the upper lip divided by a
cleft down the length of the tube; all parts of the corolla are sharp-pointed,
and flaring from the 5-parted calyx; the texture is fine and
smooth, and the color a pure pale lavender, faintly lined with dark,
white near the throat, and pinkish in the tube, the green calyx being
also tinted with pink. The flowers, on short foot-stems, are set alternately,
and close, in a long, very pretty spike.</p>

<p>There is something individual about the alert carriage of this plant,
its whole gesture is erect and animated. It grows numerously in
pastures, though in less close fellowship than its little brook sister.</p>

<p>Found on moist ground in limestone soil, blossoming in July and
August.</p>

<p>The erect, minutely angular stem, is slender, smooth and polished,
fine and at the same time strong in fibre; in color a light grass-green.</p>

<p>The small, narrow and grass-like leaf is about an inch long; towards
the root it broadens a little at the tip; color grass-green. The growth
is alternate.</p>

<p>The corolla of the small, irregular flower is in 2 divisions, the
upper one with 2 narrow, upright parts, between which the stamens
show; the lower one with 3 broad equal lobes; the color varies from
deep lavender to light, and from a bluish to a pinkish tone, the lower
division is marked with a broad white wedge-shaped spot near the
throat. The small calyx has 5 thread-like divisions, green, tinged with
lavender. From 3 to 4 flowers blossom at once on the top of the stem.</p>

<p>This little Lobelia flourishes especially in the limestone regions of
the Green Mountains. It grows in communities among the short grass,
beside some wayside spring or runlet; the flowers, all facing in the same
direction, appear as though turned to greet the wayfarer. It is a plant
of delicate finish and color, with a lithe and graceful gesture.</p>

<p>The leafy, sometimes branching stalk grows from 12 to 18 inches,
and is not large, though less slender than the Spiked Lobelia, its texture
being also coarser; it is very slightly rough to the touch, and light
green in color.</p>

<p>The leaves near the foot are about an inch long, and a blunt oval
shape; near the top they become smaller and narrower; with coarsely
toothed margins, a thin texture, and dull green color. They clasp the
stalk alternately.</p>

<p>The flowers are smaller than the other Lobelias mentioned; the
corolla is lilac, with a white spot on the lower lip; the calyx, whose 5
divisions are thread-like, is purplish-green. The flowers, on their little
foot-stems, are placed in a scattering fashion upon the stalk to form a
long terminal spike; each flower is supported by a little leaf or bract.</p>

<p>As the blossoms fall the seed-pods swell into a round and inflated
shape, which, together with the scantiness of its bloom, gives the spike
an untidy look, unusual in this class of delicate forms and elegant
proportions.</p>

moist ground, from July to October.</p>

<p>The single, rather large stalk is round, and somewhat irregularly
grooved, smooth to the touch, and a full green color. It grows from 2

<p>The leaves are generally from 2 to 3 inches in length, tapering at
both ends with the veins distinctly showing, and irregularly toothed
margins; their texture is fine, and the color a full dark green. They
are set immediately upon the stalk, in an alternate arrangement.</p>

<p>The irregular corolla is somewhat 2-lipped, with a long slender
tube which is split down its upper side; the lower lip is broad and 3-cleft,
the upper being narrow and in 2 parts; its color is a deep and
glowing red, with a darker spot near the throat upon the lower lip.
The pistil and 5 stamens, which curve outwards noticeably, are of a
lighter red color with fine gray tips; the calyx is 5-parted and green.
The flowers are arranged in a long, usually one-sided, spike.</p>

<p>Coming into bloom when the midsummer vegetation is growing
dusty, this plant fills the eye with the richness of its dark green leafage
toned into perfect accord with the glowing hue of its flowers,—their
color a truly royal one, of unusual depth as well as brilliancy. The
Cardinal Flower should not be plucked ruthlessly, lest it be
exterminated, an ever-present danger to the beautiful annuals man appreciates.
It can be cultivated from the seed with considerable success.</p>

<p>Found during July and August in rocky soil, along roadside
thickets; in damp shade, or on exposed and barren uplands.</p>

<p>The stems of this lovely plant are very slender, like leafy wands,
from 10 to 16 inches in height; they are firm and fine in fibre, smooth
and shining, and bronzy-green.</p>

<p>The grass-like leaf is about an inch long, fine and thin and smooth;
its color betrays the violet hues that temper all the green parts of
the plant.</p>

<p>The blossom varies in size rather noticeably. Its corolla is shaped
like a bell with 5 small pointed tips which curve outward to show
the long lavender pistil with its malachite-green tip; the texture of the
bell is delicately thin and yet firm, and the color an exquisite violet,
which ranges from pale lavender, or even almost white, to a reddish-purple
hue. The green calyx is 5-parted, its divisions very slender,
half as long as the bell, and clinging closely to its shape. The many
blossoms nod on thread-like stems.</p>

<p>In early spring the Harebell plant consists of a tuffet of small,
round, slightly notched leaves, on spreading stems; these mostly disappear
when the flowering stems begin to rise. In part, the swaying,
flexile grace of gesture belonging to these flowers may be due to the
light way in which the bells are caught in their tiny calices. When
advanced in maturity the pistil becomes 3-parted and loses its vivid
green tip. The Harebell is commonly credited with a love of shade,
but it is frequently found in the crevices of exposed rock-ledges; and a
favorite haunt, in one instance, is a bare mountain ridge, covered only
by thick dry gray mosses, where these lovely bells nod amidst the
Ebony Fern leaves (<i lang="la">A. ebeneum</i>), in thrifty vigor under the broad
sunlight.</p>

from 2 to 4 feet in height; light green.</p>

<p>The root-leaves are small, and heart-shaped, with scalloped margins,
set on stems that are sometimes 6 inches long. The lowest leaves along
the stalk are shaped like an Indian arrow-point; the upper leaves are
long and narrow: the margins are irregularly toothed, they are thin in
texture, hairy, and light green; and are set on short broad stems which
clasp the stalk alternately.</p>

<p>The corolla is bell-shaped with 5 outward-curving, tapering tips,
and a beautiful violet-blue color; the pistil is 3-parted, protruding, and
purple tinted; the green calyx is 5-parted, its divisions abruptly turned
back. The flowers are set along one side of the stalk in the angles of
the small upper leaves, forming a long wand-like spire.</p>

when the tip has begun to hang out its noticeable bells, fresh buds will
push forth far below, and open beside the old dried blossoms at the
foot,—for the withered flower clings long to the calyx.</p>

<p>Found in the woods, or clearings near woods, and upland pastures,
during April. It particularly favors pine woods.</p>

<p>The branching leafy stalk is low, and trailing close to the ground
under dry leaves and dead grass; it is tough and woody-fibred, and
rough-hairy to the touch; rather slender. Its color is rusty brown, and
very rich in tone.</p>

<p>The oval leaf is heart-shaped at the base, with a strong midrib
which is somewhat taut and gives the entire margin usually an undulating
character; the fibre is tough, and rough to the touch. The color
is a strong positive green, more or less worm-eaten, and rust-spotted; it
is evergreen. The leaves are set, on slender rough stems, alternately,
at irregular intervals, and more closely near the flowers. The new
leaves come after the blossoming time.</p>

<p>The flower has a tubular corolla, spreading into 5 rounded points;
its color varies from an exquisite white to a deeply tinted rose; the inconspicuous
stamens show only as a feathery, pale yellow ring in the
centre. The 5-parted, pale green calyx is set around with 5 similar
leafy bracts. The blossoms, on their little foot-stems, are gathered in
close clusters along the ends of the stalk and branches. They exhale
a sweet and spicy fragrance.</p>

<p>The plant, with its green and rusty leaves, hugs the earth so
closely that often only the tips of the flowery clusters show here and
there among the dried leaves, which almost conceal them from their
friendly enemies, whose love of their beauty knows no better manner
of exhibiting itself than by tearing the vine up by its roots. This
selfish ignorance is fast exterminating the lovely flower in the populous
districts of New England,—already it has become in certain place as
mere tradition. As though in revenge, nature keeps fast the secret of
its growth, and the Arbutus refuses to live in man’s care for more than
one or two seasons.</p>

<p>This shrub, about 3 or 4 feet high, branches often, and is tough-fibred;
the bark when new is smooth, but is inclined to become frayed
and to split when it is old. The color is brown, of a golden hue.</p>

<p>The leaf is oval, widest near the tip, the midrib is prominent beneath,
the margin is entire and slightly thickened on the edge, the
texture is coarse grained and tough, but not thick; while the upper
surface is smooth and shining, the underside is dull. It is evergreen;
in color green, rusty underneath. The arrangement is alternate, and
close together, and the leaves are so set as to point upwards; their
short stems are often reddish.</p>

<p>The corolla is a small 5-pointed bell, curved inwards at the throat
and spreading its points to show the thread-like, green pistil; of a fine
smooth texture and pure white; the 5-parted calyx is curved closely to
the bell,—white, or yellow, or tawny-tinted; at its base are found 2
little rusty, or white bracts. The flowers are set on short rusty stems

<p>Found in swamps and marsh lands, in May.</p>

<p>This shrub grows between 1 and 2 feet high; it is branching, leafy,
and slender, with a woody fibre. The bark on the young shoots is
smooth and firm, when old it is rough and inclined to split.</p>

<p>The leaf is evergreen. In shape it is long and needle-like, a
resemblance caused by its closely rolled edges which give it a stiff
erectness of bearing; the texture is firm and dry, its upper surface
being slightly grained, though it is smooth underneath. In color it is a
dark, rich green, pale beneath. The leaves are set, on very short tawny
stems, close together, and alternately.</p>

<p>The mouth of the small bell-shaped flower is almost closed; its
oval form is diversified by the little pinched folds which run up from
between its 5 little tips. In color it is a rosy tinted white; the little
5-parted calyx being colored like the corolla. The bells are set on
short white foot-stems that are enfolded by tiny greenish-pink bracts;
they are close gathered in small groups, and nod at the ends of the
branches.</p>

<p>The fine-pointed leaves, whatever the angle from which they
spring, all turn upward, giving a curious flat and conventionally
decorative effect to the branches.</p>

<p>Found in moist wayside thickets and swamps; blossoming in June.</p>

<p>The tough, woody stalk, erect, branching, and leafy, is covered with
a smooth, light gray bark. It grows from 3 to 6, or more, feet in height.</p>

<p>The small leaves are from 1 to 2 inches long, tapering at both ends;
they are alternate, on very short foot-stems. The margin is entire, or
very finely notched, surface smooth, and texture firm. Color, green.</p>

<p>The small, bell-shaped flower is nearly round, with 5 tiny, <span class="cor" title="Source: re-curved" id="cor376">recurved</span>
points at the top. It is inconspicuous in color, being of a dull greenish
white, the tawny stamens showing within. The flowers, on short,
curved stems, hang from one side of the twigs, on the ends of the
branches.</p>

<p>The seed-case is small, round, brown, and 5-parted; it is especially
noticeable in winter and early spring, and is at all times more
attractive to the eye than the colorless flowers,—it adds a graceful touch
to the winter bouquet gathered by the twig-loving wayfarer.</p>

<p>Found in swamps, moist woods, and on hillsides in May.</p>

<p>This woody-fibred, branching, and leafy shrub, varies in height
from 3 to 6 feet; it has a light, warm-gray bark, nearly smooth to the
touch.</p>

<p>The charming leaf is oval in shape, tapering at both ends, with an
entire margin; its texture is thin, and the fine surface bears a few soft
short scattering hairs. In color it is a light pure golden green. The
growth is alternate, and somewhat clustering.</p>

<p>The large flower is, in shape, a long slender tube spreading at the
top into 5 long-pointed divisions with a fold in the center of each; the
5 stamens and pistil are all long and slender, extending their curving
ends far out from the tube; the calyx is hardly noticeable. The color
of the corolla varies from pale to deep rose-pink, the tone deepening
toward the base of the tube, while the stamens and pistil are rosy
crimson,—the tip of the pistil is pinkish-brown. The flowers grow in
groups of 5 or more, on short pale green stems, from the ends of the
branches. They are very fragrant.</p>

<p>The very essence of spring seems to dwell in the pink and green
colors and the spicy breath of this Azalea. The gesture in dropping
its flowers is graceful,—the blossom, sliding down the long pistil, hangs
swaying on its tip for some time before it finally drops softly to the
earth. The branches, especially the lower ones, swing out from the
bush in long free curves.</p>

<p>Found in swamps and wet lands during July.</p>

<p>This shrub grows from 4 to 6 or even 7 feet high, and branches
less regularly than the Pink <span class="cor" title="Source: Azalia" id="cor380">Azalea</span>, and is somewhat less leafy in habit;
it is rather slender, woody-fibred, and the bark is dry and slightly rough.
In color, reddish-gray.</p>

<p>The oval leaf is widest near the tip whose extreme point is noticeably
sharp; its midrib is marked, and the margin is entire, the edge
and underside of the midrib being hairy; the texture is thin and firm,
the upper surface glossy. The color of the new growths is a fine
green (less golden than its sister) which becomes dark when older. The
leaves grow in clustered groups.</p>

<p>The flower is smaller than the earlier Azalea, and its points are
more curled; it is pure white in color, the outside of the tube being
covered with tiny red hairs which are sticky to the touch. The white
stamens, with their straw-colored tips, are shorter than the pistil which
is faintly pink-tinted, with a darker tip. The calyx is not observable
without close inspection; the green foot-stems are very short; and the
flowers are grouped terminally upon the twigs.</p>

<p>There is a reddish tinge to the bud, and the flower is delightfully
odorous, and the blooming time is pleasantly prolonged.</p>

<p>The woody, branching stalk, from 1 to 2 feet high, has a smooth,
thin, green bark.</p>

<p>The oval leaves are small, about an inch long, unbroken on the
edge, and set opposite each other on scarcely perceptible stems; they
are rather few in number, fine in texture, smooth, and of a light green
color.</p>

<p>The small, bell-like corolla is slightly contracted at the top,
5-parted, with the small tips rolled back. Color white, more or less
tinged and streaked with light red. There are 10 orange-tipped
stamens, and 1 pale green pistil; the 5-parted calyx is green, tinged
with red. The flowers hang on short stems, drooping in clusters of 5
to 7, or more, from the ends of the twigs.</p>

<p>The flowers appear while the leafage still shows the red flush of
the new growth. The green twiggery of this low bush gives an early
promise of spring, long before the leaves think of showing themselves.
The round, sweet and juicy berries, dark blue with a fine bloom, surrounded
by the harmonious green of the leafage, have a decided charm
of color too rarely noted by those who seek them for their edible
qualities only.</p>

<p>Found in June, in dry woods.</p>

<p>A branching, leafy shrub, which grows from 2 to 4 feet high; its
stalk is stout, and woody, and covered with a gray bark.</p>

<p>The oval leaf seems rather small for the size of the bush; it has an
entire margin, a firm texture that is somewhat tough-fibred, and smooth
surface. Color, light green, and pale beneath. The leaves are set on
very short stems, alternately.</p>

<p>The small bell-shaped corolla spreads into 5 outward curving
points; it is white. The stamens form a close, pointed cluster about
the pistil and hang out from the flower bell,—they are dull orange in
color; the small calyx is green. These bells swing on slender stems,
from the angles of little leaves, in thick clusters along the lower sides
of the branches.</p>

<p>The Deerberry’s branches stretch out in a nearly horizontal direction;
its profusion of pretty bells begin to open while still undeveloped,
and are about a fortnight in coming to their full beauty, to which a
pleasing touch of individuality is given by the orange-tipped stamens.
The fruit is flat to the taste, and gives the bush its second folk-name.</p>

<p>Found in rocky pastures, uplands and light woods, and swampy
grounds, in June.</p>

<p>This is a large shrub varying in height from 4 to 8 feet, and occasionally
taller. Its stalk and branches are more or less twisted and
angular in growth, and woody, of a fibre compact and tough; the old
growths are covered with a roughened gray bark.</p>

<p>The beautiful leaf is evergreen; of an oval shape, with a tapering
tip, an entire margin, strong midrib, a firm fine texture, and a smooth
surface. The color is a fine dark green in the old growths, a light
vigorous green when new. The leaves, on very short stems, are usually
placed alternately, but are sometimes opposite each other, and toward
the end of the branches are clustered.</p>

<p>The corolla is bowl-shaped, with 5 or 6 points; around the middle
of this bowl are 10 little pockets,—each one of which holds the tip of
a stamen until it is ready to spring out and scatter its pollen,—these
pockets, or sacs, projecting on the outside of the bowl, form little spurs
all around it. The color of the flower is white, or pink; in the bottom
of the bowl a 10-pointed star is outlined in dark crimson, and flecks of
crimson occur just above the little pockets. The tiny seed-box in the
center is green; the elastic stamens are silky white; the little calyx is
green; the flower-stems pale and sticky. The flowers form large and
conspicuous clusters on the ends of the branches.</p>

<p>The flowers and buds have a pretty shell-like quality. Shortly
after flowering, the vigorous light green shoots put forth, and the ripening
seed-boxes take on a crimson hue, making the Laurel pasture all
aglow a second time with rich color. This 5-angled seed-box, turned to
brown, remains throughout the winter in pleasing contrast to the fine
evergreen leafage.</p>

<p>This shrub is between 1 and 2 feet in height; it is woody-fibred,
hard and firm, with a thin, close bark. The branches are curious in
growth, being formed of short sections that are two-edged and somewhat
flat; these sections are placed alternately and at right angles to each
other. The color is a dark rich brown.</p>

<p>The leaf is oblong, with a blunt tip, and a noticeably rolled-under
edge; the surface is glossy above, and the texture is tough. It is evergreen,
dark above and whitey-green underneath, the midrib being
yellowish. The leaves grow in pairs, upon very short stems that spring
from the section-joints, at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The flower is small, similar to the Mountain Laurel; of a clear light
crimson color, with dark-tipped stamens. The blossoms are set on dull
crimson-red stems, and arranged in terminal groups.</p>

<p>This is rather rare, and not easy to become acquainted with owing
to its preference for swamp holes. The tiny seed-pods on their thread
stems are very pretty.</p>

<p>This branching, very leafy, bush is 18 inches to 2 or 3 feet in
height, with a woody fibre, and tough bark. The new shoots are green,
the older growths turning to reddish-brown.</p>

<p>The leaf is a long oval, with a rolled-under edge; not large, but
otherwise like that of the Mountain Laurel. It is evergreen, the old
growths dark and dull, with rusty spots of weather-wear; the fresh
leaves are bright green, the midrib being yellow, with a hint of pink
underneath. The leaves are set on short stems, and placed in little
groups near together.</p>

<p>The blossom is smaller and more shallow than the Mountain
Laurel; it is in color a strong dark pink, with the star design outlined
in dark crimson. The 10 stamens are shining, and pale pink, with
crimson tips; the curved pistil is light pink. The flowers, on tiny foot-stems,
are arranged in loose clusters, of a dozen or more, upon a short
stem; these clusters are placed in a whorl about the stalk, at the
summit of last year’s growth, and beneath the over-topping new shoot.</p>

<p>The old leaves bend downward, while the new stretch themselves
upward, holding their tips nearly erect.</p>

It is set on a short, margined, reddish stem, which is protected at the
ground by an enfolding dark sheath.</p>

<p>The 5 petals of the flower form a cup; they are thin and waxen

stamens huddle all together in the upper part of the cup; the long
curved pistil is down-bent; the calyx is 5-parted, flat, and green.
Several flowers on short, down-turned, green-reddish stems, are placed

<p>Found during July in woods, and along the edges of woods.</p>

<p>The creeping stalk sends up an erect stem, leafy at the top, about
4 or 5 inches high, woody-fibred and tough, and smooth to the touch.
Its color is green,—red toward the root.</p>

<p>The leaf is a broad oval, with a rounded tip, an obscurely notched
margin, of a tough and thick fibre, and smooth, polished surface. It is
evergreen: when old a dark green, often bronzy; more yellow-green,
tinged with dull red, when young. The alternate leaves, on very short
stems, are clustered at the top of the stalk.</p>

<p>The small bell-shaped flower is minutely 5-parted, and all white.
The flowers, on short curving stems, grow singly from the angles of the
leaves, hanging their bells downward.</p>

<p>The fruit is round and small, a bright cherry red in color; it ripens
in the fall and remains throughout snow-time, always ready to lend its
glowing color, with the bronzy leaves that surround it, to a winter
bouquet from the woods. The new shoots put forth from the ground
in June, and are called “youngsters” in the country; they have an
aromatic, pungent flavor, and going “youngstering” is a favorite diversion
of childhood. The plant is a great colonist, and year after year
its plantations thrive in the same localities.</p>

<p>Found growing upon the roots of pine or oak trees, from June to

<p>The single and erect stalk is about 6 or 8 inches high; thick, fleshy,
and smooth, or downy. It is pale at the foot, deepening to a crimson-red
near the flowers.</p>

<p>The small and sheath-like bracts are indeterminate in shape, thin
and dry. In color yellow-red, turning blackish when withered. A few
only occur upon the stalk.</p>

<p>The small flowers are irregularly vase-shaped, and composed of 8
or 10 narrow fleshy parts with crinkled tips; they are set on short
stems, in the clasp of a bract, and arranged in terminal groups of 2 to 5
in number. The color is rosy-red, with yellow tips,—flowers, bracts,
and the top of the stalk following the same scheme of color.</p>

<p>A parasite, growing upon the roots, and, though not unpleasing in
general aspect when perfectly fresh, betraying the base quality of its
nature when mature, for an unwholesome mould spreads over its parts
as it grows old. When first opened the flowers turn down, but become
erect with age.</p>

<p>The thick, round, flower-stem varies from 3 to 8 inches in height,
and is fleshy, smooth, and clammy. Its color is white, or faintly
flesh-tinted.</p>

<p>The small, scaly bracts, which serve for leaves, are white.</p>

<p>The large bell-shaped flower is formed of 5 long, narrow, fleshy
white parts, whose tips flare a little. The 10 stamens are dull tawny.
The flowers are nodding, usually solitary, though sometimes 2 or even
3 are grouped on one stem.</p>

<p>A parasitic growth on roots and decaying vegetable matter,
speedily turning black when gathered, the Indian Pipe displays none
of the pleasing attributes commonly associated with healthful sun-loving
vegetation. It is, by nature, designed for the semi-twilight of
the dark forest, and illy bears transportation into the brighter light
of the open; even in the shadows of the woods, it is often found
covered by dead leaves.</p>

<p>Found in moist shade during May.</p>

<p>This very slender and smooth little stalk grows from 3 to 5 inches
in height, bears one or two sheath-like leaves near the root, and terminates
in a whorl of leaves at the top. It is green, slightly reddish at
the foot.</p>

<p>The long leaf is sharp-pointed at both ends, with an entire margin,
a thin and delicate texture which shows plainly the pattern-like tracery
of the ribs and veins, and a shining surface; the color is a full green.
6, or more, leaves, of unequal size, spread in a whorl upon the summit
of the stalk.</p>

<p>The flower has 7 nearly diamond-shaped parts, of a thin texture,
and pure white color; they spread flat, their edges just overlapping in a
7-pointed star, the 7 long, and narrow, greenish divisions of the calyx
alternating with them; the 10 thread-like stamens are white, with
orange tips. A single flower, borne on a slender stem, rises from the
whorl of leaves.</p>

<p>The number of the corolla-divisions sometimes varies, but 7 is the
usual measure. It is noticeable that the flower-stem is set a trifle underneath
the lap of the leaves, causing an inclination of the star to one
side. A tiny leaf is found sitting on the stalk just under the leafy
canopy.</p>

<p>The stalk, from 12 to 18 inches in height, is branching near the
top, leafy, and smooth, but grooved beneath the branches; it is hollow,
and has a stiff fibre; pale yellow-green.</p>

<p>The long and narrow oval leaf is sometimes 2 and 3 inches long
and only ½ an inch in width; its texture is thin, its surface very smooth,
and the margin entire. The color is a light yellow-green. The leaves
clasp the stalk in pairs, which occur at right angles to each other, and
are near together.</p>

<p>The flowers are about half an inch across, otherwise in color and
shape exactly resembling <i lang="la">L. quadrifolia</i>; they are set on inch long
stems, and arranged in irregular rings about the stalk, forming a noticeable
feathery spike, 5 or 6 inches in length.</p>

<p>The blossoms open first at the bottom of the spike, several rings
flowering at one time. The branches occur in pairs, symmetrically.</p>

<p>The single, smooth, 4-angled stalk is from 2 to 3 feet in height,
and a shining, light green color, sometimes bronzy.</p>

<p>The leaf is long oval, blunt or very slightly heart-shaped at the
base, tapering to a long and very sharp tip; the margin is entire, the
ribs noticeable, and the upper surface is velvety to the touch; the color
light green. The leaves are set on short stems, which are fringed with
erect hairs along their upper edges, and arranged in pairs, the pairs
being at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The rather large corolla has 5 divisions of a rounded oval shape
with an abrupt little tip; their outer margin is somewhat puckered,
the texture thin, and the color a pure light yellow,—about their bases is
a reddish marking that makes a ring in the center of the flower; the
5 erect stamens are straw-color, and the long pistil is green; the calyx
is 5-parted, and full green in color. The flowers, on slender foot-stems,
are placed by twos and fours on leafy stems, that spring terminally, and
from the angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>Found in waste places and sandy soil, from June to September.</p>

<p>The several stems of this spreading plant lie upon the ground in a
close mat; they are square, the sides being twisted; smooth, shining,
and light green. They are commonly about 6 inches in length, but
vary somewhat.</p>

<p>The small oval leaf is widest at the base, entire, weak and loose in
texture, and dull green, the under side speckled with faint purple dots.
The leaves occur in pairs at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The pretty little flower is very variable in color; its 5-parted and
round-pointed corolla is purple, blue or white sometimes, but most
commonly is orange-red with a violet ring in the center, while the collar
which unites the 5 white stamens (they have yellow tips) is red-violet—a
curious color combination. The calyx is 5-parted, shallow, and
green. The flowers, on thread-like stems, occur in pairs, springing from
the angles of the leaves along the stalk.</p>

<p>The lowest buds open first; the blossoms last but a day,—they do
not often spread in overcast weather, nor open until the sun is shining
full, and they close by four o’clock in the afternoon. This habit causes
the folk-name, which is more surely applicable to the plant when it
grows by the sea, for though it is found inland in a flourishing condition,
it is never acclimated thoroughly enough to adjust its reckoning
with the weather, and is continually making false forecasts in its calculations.</p>

The leaves, on short, thick purple stems, are placed in pairs, at alternate
angles with one another.</p>

<p>The tubes belonging to the crown of this rather large flower are
long and oval in shape, their horns being short and broad with suddenly-straight
tips; the lobes are long, oval, and widely flaring; all these
parts are colored a strong, dark glowing crimson. The flowers are set
on foot-stems that are twice their own length, and pale green in color;
they are arranged in a loose cluster upon a short, stout purplish stem,
and grow terminally, and from the angles of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>This plant is inappropriately designated <i lang="la">purpurascens</i>, since its full
and beautiful crimson flowers are unusually pure in tone.</p>

<p>Found in moist and shady banks in July.</p>

<p>The leafy stalk is not hollow, but very milky, of a close, firm fibre;
it is smooth or slightly downy—especially when young; from 2 to 5
feet in height; clear green.</p>

<p>The large lower leaves (5 or 6 inches long by 3 inches in width)
are oval, pointed at both ends; the upper are narrower; their margins
are entire, midribs strong, and texture very thin and fine, downy and
pleasant to the touch. In color a clear green, paler beneath, the midrib
being pinkish above. They are set on short stems, in pairs, which grow
at alternate angles.</p>

<p>The flower is large; its oval lobes are very much reversed, and
colored a clear light green; the crown tubes are broad, short, and
notched at their tips; the horns are long and needle-pointed, they curve,
and meet together in the center; these parts are all ivory white, while
the little calyx is green. The flowers nod and droop on long, slender,
pale foot-stems that hang in a loose cluster on a stout thick stem, which
springs from the angle of a side leaf.</p>

<p>Sometimes the plant bears more than one of these flower-clusters;
it is the most delicate of our common Milkweeds, exceeding even the
Four-leaved in fineness, and the ivory white of its flower crown is remarkable
for its clarity of hue.</p>

<p>The stalk branches often for the flowers; it is leafy, and grows
from 2 to 3 feet high, with a strong fibre, its surface is hairy and its
color is a strong green, purplish near the foot, and red-orange below the
flower-clusters. The juice is not milky.</p>

green.</p>

<p>The leaf is often very large (from 4 to 8 inches long), oval, rounded

<hr class="tb">

<p>The seed-pods of the Milkweeds are most interesting; rough on the
outside, they are beautifully finished within, with a fine, smooth, light
lining. The silky plumes of the flat-brown seeds are closely folded
together and the seeds lie overlapping like the scales of a fish. The
light green outside of the Butterfly-Weed pod, tinged with crimson-tawny,
becomes with age a fine tree-trunk gray. In some varieties a
likeness to a dove may be found in the inverted pod.</p>

<p>Found in fields, pastures, and along wayside thickets, frequently
where it is damp; coming into bloom late in August and continuing
until middle October or later.</p>

<p>The stalk, which branches for the flowers, grows usually from 6
inches to 2 feet in height, and is somewhat square near the blossoms,
and sometimes twisted; it is grooved, smooth and shining, and light
green, tempered with bronze.</p>

<p>The leaf is heart-shaped at the base, tapering sharply to a long-pointed
tip, slightly creased on the midrib, with an entire margin, and
thin smooth texture. In color it is light green. The leaves clasp the
stalk in pairs, which occur at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The corolla is a deep vase shape spreading at the top into 4 fringed
lobes which curve like shells; of a delicate thin texture, and satin
smooth surface, in color an evasive azure, impossible to describe, varying
from pale to deep (sometimes reddish tinted), and marked upon the
outside with fine lines of darker blue. The 4-parted calyx is pinched
into 4 angles at its base, and is a light yellow-green color, its long,
sharp tips sometimes bronzy. The flowers are set on short, and long,
leafy stems; in groups, or singly.</p>

<p>Though often low, and bearing but one flower, it is not uncommon
to find a single tall stalk adorned with a dozen or two of blossoms, and
a reliable observer reports having found plants 5 feet in stature, and
bearing upwards of a hundred flowers and buds apiece! This remarkable
luxuriance could only have occurred in some solitary mountain glen
unknown to the gentian-hunter, who, between greedy admiration of its
beauty and ignorance of its habits, is doing his best to exterminate the
plant. The seeds are exceedingly capricious in their choice of a home,
and refuse to germinate when garden-sown. For the æsthetic pleasure
also it is best not to pluck them; their charm loses its subtlety when
carried into civilized environments—the spirit of their loveliness escapes
imprisonment.</p>

stout, smooth, and green.</p>

<p>The leaf is large (from 2 to 4 inches long), usually bread oval in

the surface is smooth, and the color a rich green that is frequently
weather-worn and rusty. The leaves are set in pairs upon the stalk.</p>

<p>The flower is like a closed bud which never opens, an inflated club-shape
from 1 to 1 and ½ inches in length; the corolla is a dark purple-blue
color, growing lighter near the base, and in its folds; the 5-parted
calyx is more or less green. The flowers are gathered together in a
close cluster of four or five, upon the summit of the stalk, amidst the
numerous green leaves.</p>

<p>Found in moist meadows, and by brooks and runnels, flowering
in June and July.</p>

<p>The large, somewhat square stalk, from 9 to 20 inches in height, is
branching and leafy, rather roughish of surface, with short rootlets
starting out on its sides, and light green. It supports itself upon surrounding
vegetation.</p>

<p>The leaf, 2 or 3 inches long, is oval with a blunt tip, and partly
clasping the stalk; its surface roughened with fine hairs, and it is light
green in color.</p>

<p>The small 5-lobed flower is about a quarter of an inch across; its
corolla is very fine and even in texture, in color light blue (occasionally
pink) with a center of harmonious yellow; the calyx is small, 5-parted,
and green. The buds are pinkish. The flowers grow in curving, one-sided,
terminal clusters,—sometimes from the angles of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>This is one of the few true blue flowers of our flora; its color is
pure and opaque, like that of a turquoise, or a fine enamel, and falls
into harmony with the yellow of the center through an exquisite
gradation of color. The plant remains in flower a long time, continually
forming new buds, and leaving behind the little empty green calyx-cups
on its ever-lengthening stem. The blossom of the wild plant is
larger than that usually cultivated in the gardens; it is easily propagated
by means of cuttings.</p>

<p>Found in July, in pastures chiefly, though occasionally straying
along country roads.</p>

<p>The stalk, from 3 to 4 or 5 feet in height, is large, and strong; it
is branching with short stems which diminish as they near the top; the
fibre is coarse, it is roughened with hairs, and its light green color is
frequently dotted with rusty-purple freckles.</p>

<p>The lower leaves are very long and narrow, occasionally cut or
rudely notched on the edge, while the pointed upper leaves are entire;
the texture is coarse, and rough to the touch; the color is green. The
arrangement is alternate.</p>

<p>The flower is an irregular vase-shape, spreading into 5 rounding
divisions of unequal length, with a very small, green, 5-parted calyx;
the corolla is a bright deep blue, the 4 stamens and the pistil are rose-colored.
Several flowers are set in a single row along the upper side
of a short stem, which is coiled tightly at first, but straightens itself as
the rose-colored buds expand. Many of these stems form a large and
conspicuous terminal spike; and singly grow from the upper branches.</p>

<p>It is a pity this striking plant should have invaded the farmers’
pastures in such bold colonies as to be reckoned by him a pest, and so
uprooted, for absolute blue flowers are rare. It deserves especial regard
because of its unusual color combination of ultramarine and rose. The
“spotted stem made men once think it efficacious for cure of viper’s
bites, and its seeds, shaped like a viper’s head, confirmed the notion.”</p>

a short, downy, reddish stem. The arrangement is alternate.</p>

<p>The flower is large; the corolla a beautiful vase shape with a
rolling, slightly 5-angled rim, in texture fine and thin, the outside of the
throat shining; within the vase, at the bottom, may be seen 5 deep
pits; it is of a pure and exquisite white, toned to creamy-green near
the calyx; the 5 stamens are cream colored while the 2-tipped pistil is
white. The greenish calyx is 5-parted with small pointed divisions
which are almost concealed by the 2 longer, pale green bracts that
clasp together closely about its throat. The flower is set on a rather
large, flat, downy, pale stem which rises from the angle of a leaf. The
plant bears but few flowers.</p>

<p>Far less common than the Bindweed this flower must be reckoned
a treasure-trove by its finder. Its texture is so thin that the calyx-color

<p>Found on roadside banks, and in dry copses, during May.</p>

<p>Several flower-bearing, leafy, stout stems, 6 to 10 inches high,
spring from a foot tuffet of leaves.</p>

<p>The foot-leaves are large and long, and set on long, wide, grooved,
hairy stems; the stem leaves taper at each end, and are at first set on
short stems, and above clasping; all the leaves are often and regularly
cut like a feather, a resemblance increased by the finely toothed margin;
with strong midribs, coarse texture, and shining surfaces. The color
is dark green, the lower leaves dashed with red-purple, the stems being
also red-purple. The leaves occur alternately, and not near together,
along the stems.</p>

<p>This curious flower is 2-lipped: the upper is flat and curved,
with a two-pronged tip, the lower is 3-lobed, the edges curled inward;
their surface shining; the upper lip is a dark purplish-red, the lower,
pale yellow, while the throat is reddish. The pistil pushes out between
the prongs of the upper lip. The deep and somewhat square calyx is
parted beneath the lower lip; it is of a coarse, and hairy aspect, and
colored light green, edged with dark red. The flowers, set close, in the
hold of little bract-like leaves, are arranged spirally, in a round terminal
spike.</p>

<p>As the fresh blossoms climb upward the spike lengthens and becomes
club-shaped. The withered flowers cling long after their color
has faded; when newly opened, they are all yellow, their beak-like
upper lips only faintly flushed with the red, which, presently, assumes
so sanguinary a hue that there is some occasion for the waggery of the
local folk-name of “Beefsteak Plant.”</p>

<p>Found in swampy places during August and September.</p>

<p>The sometimes branching stalk, from 1 to 2 or 8 feet in height, is
round, shining, and generally smooth, or with an occasional roughness.
Light green in color.</p>

<p>The long oval leaf is cut into oblong divisions, and the margin is
finely toothed, which increases its resemblance to a fern leaf; the strong
ribs show plainly, and the color is pale green, inclining to yellow. The
leaves, on short stems, are placed in pairs, which point at right angles
to each other.</p>

<p>The corolla has a curious one-sided look, because the curving beak-like
upper lip closes so tightly down upon the 3-lobed under lip as to
push it askew; its color is a pale and somewhat muddy yellow. The
2-parted calyx is deep, and the tips spread; it is green. The flowers
are set within the hold of little curved and notched leaves like bracts,
in pairs, forming a terminal spike.</p>

<p>Only two or three flowers bloom at one time, and the withered corollas
cling long to the calices, which gives an untidy appearance to the
plant. The leaf and calyx are decorative in growth.</p>

<p>Found in June, growing in low grounds, and wet meadows.</p>

<p>The single, leafy stalk rises from a cluster of root-leaves; it is 8 to
10 inches in height, somewhat square-angled, and hollow, of a tough,
rather course fibre, with a hairy surface. Color, dull crimson, the short
hairs being gray or white.</p>

<p>The root-leaves are oblong, seldom notched; on the stalk the lowest
leaves are narrow, while above they are wedge-shaped and generally
deeply cleft into 3 lobes; the margins are entire, and the surface is
hairy. In color a light clear green; the ends of the upper leaves and
those which supports the flowers look as though they had been dipped
in a scarlet dye. The leaves all sit immediately upon the stalk; they are
placed alternately, and at some distance apart, but more crowded among
the flowers.</p>

<p>The small corolla of the flower is tubular and 2-lipped, yellow and
green in color; it is almost concealed within the long cylindrical 2-cleft
calyx, which is colored a clear light green with a scarlet margin. The
long curving pistil is green tinted. The flowers are set in the clasp of
the upper leaves, and form a close terminal cluster.</p>

<p>Quite eclipsed by the gorgeous hues of the floral leaves and calices,
the paler flower hides its head, its long pistil alone claiming attention.
The exact marking of the vivid scarlet upon the tips makes the folk-name
“Paintbrush” more applicable to its general aspect, than that of
“Painted Cup,” which of course only applies to the effect of the single
calyx. In some localities the color is not scarlet, but yellow, it is reported.
The plant is called a parasite by the botanists: it therefore
may not be transplanted but glows in splendid patches of color in
favorite camps of its own choosing.</p>

<p>Found, from May to July, in grassy fields, and along roadsides.</p>

<p>Many branches, varying from 3 to 7 inches in length, spring from
the root, and lie on the ground (sometimes rooting so), their tips lifted
erect among the grass blades; its growth is slender, leafy, firm of fibre,
and smooth. Color green.</p>

<p>The small leaf is oval, with an entire, or slightly irregular, margin,
prominent midrib, and smooth surface. In color, a cool green; the leaves,
on short stems, are placed in pairs, near together,—at the end of the
branch they become crowded.</p>

<p>The corolla is small, and resembles that of the Brooklime; delicate
in texture and in color pure white, or streaked with lavender, or blue.
The points of the 4-parted green calyx just show between the lobes of
the flower. The two stamens are lavender tipped. The flowers, on small
foot-stems, spring from the angles of the leaves for a considerable distance
along the ends of the branches.</p>

<p>Contrary to the usual habit of the Speedwells these flowers do not
fall immediately after they are picked.</p>

<p>The rather large stalk, sometimes creeps and then lifts itself to
the height of 10 or 15 inches; it is hollow, juicy, and fine-fibred,
and smooth. Pale green in color.</p>

<p>The long, oval leaf has a grooved midrib and slightly notched
margin; it is juicy, and smooth. In color light green. The leaves, on
short broad flat stems, that clasp the stalk, are placed in pairs, at right
angles to each other.</p>

<p>The little circular corolla is cut into 4 scallops, of which 3 are
round-pointed and of equal size, while the fourth is narrower and a
trifle longer; the texture is delicate. The color is very pretty, a
lavender-blue with slightly darker markings,—the center is white; the
2 stamens are pale purple. The calyx is 4-parted, the divisions narrow
and pointed; green. The flowers, set on thread-stems, are placed in
little, loose, terminal spires.</p>

<p>A first cousin to the Speedwell of English poetry. These tiny
blossoms fall almost as soon as they open their pretty blue eyes, therefore
let the observer rest content, without trying to pluck the tender
stalks.</p>

<p>The leafy stalk lies along the ground, with the flower-stems rising
from it; it is round, downy, and tough. In color green.</p>

<p>The oval leaf, broad and rounded at the tip, tapers at the base
into an exceedingly short stem: the edge is notched, and the surface
downy. The leaves are set in pairs, and are of a rather light green
color.</p>

<p>The small 4-parted flower shows the mark of the Speedwells in the
inequality of the divisions, the lower one being much narrower than
the other three. There are two stamens, a pistil, and a small green
4-parted calyx. The flowers are closely set on slender spires, rising
from the angles of the leaves. Their color is a light lavender, lined
with a darker tone.</p>

<p>The flat, heart-shaped pods ripen on the lower part of the spire
while the upper part continues to bloom; the flowers speed quickly
away,—with a glance, almost, they are gone, so lightly are they held

<p>Found on dry, sandy soil, in fields, and among rocks, from June to
September.</p>

<p>The single, leafy stalk rises from a foot-tuffet, to the height of 3
or 4 feet, usually, although it varies considerably; it is round, stout,
and tough-fibred, covered with wool, which tempers the green and
makes it whitey in tone.</p>

<p>The large (from 6 to 12 inches long) foot-leaves have very prominent
ribs which show chiefly underneath, entire margins, and are thick,
like a blanket with a very woolly surface; the stalk leaves are smaller,
and more pointed, and are attached to the stalk for a part of their
length,—they are otherwise like the large leaves. In color a whitish
green.</p>

<p>The corolla is rather large, somewhat unequally 5-parted with
rounded lobes, it is of a fine texture and smooth; in color, a clear pale
yellow. The tips of the 5 stamens are orange; the pistil is green, and
so is the 5-parted, woolly calyx. The flowers are set closely and numerously
in a long, compact, club-shaped, terminal spike.</p>

<p>When the flower-stalk shoots up the foot-tuffet withers, and loses
the richer color which, in spring, belongs to its leafage. The rosette
forms in the fall,—if potted and wintered in the house, free from the
choking dust of the highway, it develops a superfine quality of wool.</p>

waysides.</p>

<p>The leafy, large, round stalk grows to be 2 or 3 feet high; it is
tough-fibred, and the surface is ridgy and smooth; light green.</p>

<p>The large leaf is oblong in shape with an irregularly notched and
toothed margin; its stout midrib is flattened above, all the ribs and
veins show plainly, the texture being thin and smooth, the upper surface
somewhat glossy. The lowest leaves are on short stems, the others
are somewhat clasping; they are placed alternately, and near together.
The color is a pleasing green.</p>

<p>The corolla is like the common Mullein in shape and texture; in
color either yellow, or white, tinted with lavender. The 5 stamens,
with curiously shaped, red-orange tips, are fringed with a double row
of dull crimson, woolly threads; the pistil, also, is orange-tipped; the
calyx is 5-parted, with slender tips. The flowers, on slender stems, are
placed alternately, in long, leafy spires. All the calices, little leaves,
and foot-stems are covered with fine woolly hairs.</p>

<p>The bud is 5-sided, and the seed-box is a good deal inflated. The
peculiar orange of the stamen tips resembles a flowering moss,—their
woolly fringe, of course, occasions the name. This elegantly growing
plant, with its interesting leaf, is common only in certain localities.</p>

<p>Found in the shade of woods, in July.</p>

<p>The single, leafy stalk, which grows to be 3 or 4 feet high, is
square, and hollow; of a stiff, strong fibre, downy with soft hairs.
Dull rusty green in color.</p>

<p>The long narrow leaf is broadest at the base, with a tapering tip,
the margin is entire or slightly toothed near the base (the edge of the
lower leaves being somewhat wavy), the texture is rather thick, and
the surface is downy, and like velvet to the touch; the color is yellow-green,
slightly pinkish on the midrib. The leaves, on short, downy,
purple tinted stems, are set in pairs, at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The corolla is shaped like an urn, with 5 spreading, rounded lobes,
their edges curving or even curling in toward the center; the texture is
very fine and thin, showing the veins; the large throat is downy on the
inside; sometimes the margin is crinkled; the color is a pure yellow.
The 4 yellow stamens are divided into a long and a short pair; the pistil
is green. The calyx is 5-parted with a noticeable rounded cleft between
the divisions; it is half as long as the corolla, very downy, and green.
The flowers, on short stems, are placed in pairs in the angles of the
leaves forming a terminal spike.</p>

<p>Since the buds all incline to one side there is literally a back view
to the spike. The flowers remain some days in the fullness of bloom,
and as many as a dozen may be observed together on a single stalk;
long after they have fallen the pistil lingers. The bud is very round at
the tip, and exceptionally shining with a gloss that is lost to the
opened blossom.</p>

<p>The stalk (from 2 to 8 feet in height) is branching, and very leafy,
round, and soft to the touch, being covered with fine down. Its color

<p>The leaf is long, much cut into rounded lobes, and bearing a
general resemblance to a fern leaf; the texture is fine, and the surface
soft, and downy; in color light green. The leaves are placed upon the
stalk in pairs.</p>

<p>The tubular large corolla spreads into 5 rounded, slightly irregular
lobes, and is a little hairy in the throat; color, a pure clear yellow; the
pistil is a thread of green, and the stamens are 4 in number; the green
calyx is unequally 5-parted. The flowers, on short curving foot-stems,
are usually arranged in pairs, springing from the angles of the
upper leaves.</p>

<p>A fragrance, slightly suggestive of Sweet-Fern belongs to the
leaves. This plant is noticeable for the fine texture of its parts; the
pointed green seed-pod rising from the frill of the calyx has also a
decorative value. All the Gerardias bear the stigma of being “clandestine
root parasites,”—they do not therefore seem worthy namesakes of
the honest, nature-loving old Herbalist, Gerarde, who lived in the days
when botanists wrote plain English. According to Gray the suckers
of the roots of these plants not only fasten upon other growths, but
upon their own, thus preying upon themselves.</p>

Light gray-green in color.</p>

<p>The narrow long leaf is like a grass-blade, with an entire margin,
fine texture, and smooth surface. It is pale gray-green, lighter underneath.
The leaves are set close on the stalk, the arrangement being
alternate, and near together.</p>

<p>The flower is 2-lipped; the lower lip is 3-lobed, the middle lobe
being short and small, with a swelling above, which nearly closes the
throat of the corolla; the base of the lip is prolonged into a slender,
pointed spur; the upper lip is 2-lobed, the divisions bend outward and
over the lower lip; the texture is fine, and smooth, the throat being
lined with a glossy plush-like down; the color is a pure lemon yellow,
the protuberance on the lower lip golden-orange. The 4 stamens are
pale with cheese-colored tips; the pistil is tipped with green. The
small calyx is 5-parted, and green. The flowers, on short small foot-stems,
are arranged alternately, and close, in a terminal spike, the spurs
turning downward.</p>

<p>A charming feature of the blossom is the arch of the meeting tips
of the long pair of stamens above the shorter pair and the little pistil;
the two rows of orange velvet that run down the inside of the corolla
are also highly ornamental. This plant is a prime favorite with children,
but few among grown observers stop to consider the admirable
clarity of its lemon and orange hues. It is gregarious and grows in
colonies.</p>

grow opposite to each other, partly clasping the stalk.</p>

<p>The corolla is 2-lipped, the upper lip being erect and 2-lobed, the
lower 3-lobed, with 2 small swellings near the tightly-closed throat;
the color is a clear light violet, with 2 yellowish patches near the
throat. The pistil, and 4 stamens, which are divided into a long and
a short pair, are all whitish. The 5-angled, and 5-pointed, green calyx
is tinged with dull violet color. The flowers are set on short stems
that spring singly from the angles of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>Only a few flowers open at one time, and the plants themselves
grow sparsely, by twos and threes, among the sedgy grasses of damp
hollows, where its clear color and neat leafage render it attractive to
the sauntering observer.</p>

<p>Found, in low and swampy ground, during August and September.</p>

<p>The single stalk (from 1 to 2 or 3 feet high) is large, and square,
and grooved on the two opposite sides; it is tough-fibred, and hollow;
rigid in gesture. In color, a light yellowish-green.</p>

<p>The long, narrow, oval leaf tapers gradually to a long tip, has a
sharply toothed margin, and strongly marked ribs; it is of a coarse
tough fibre although its surface is smooth. Its color is dark green,
lighter underneath. The leaves, on very short stems, occur in pairs.</p>

<p>This curious flower is 2-lipped; the upper lip is arched, and folded
together with a slight notch in the middle of its margin, the lower lip
is 3-lobed; the throat is compressed and filled within by woolly hairs.
In texture the corolla is smooth and leathery; in color it is dull white,
or sometimes tinged faintly with pink. Under the arched upper lip
the tips of the dark, wool-covered stamens show. The calyx, formed of
5, distinct, oval, pale green parts, is surrounded by broader leafy
bracts. The flowers grow in short, crowded, terminal clusters.</p>

<p>The resemblance to the turtle or snake is most apparent in the bud
where the reptile-like mouth is quite pronounced. The plant lurks
among the sedges of swampy lands, and is generally unattractive, for
its foliage is almost always so eaten by insects that a perfect leaf is
rarely to be found.</p>

<p>Found growing from the roots of beech trees, in August, through
October.</p>

<p>The tough, branching stalk, from 6 to 12 inches high, is brown, inclining
to reddish.</p>

<p>There are no leaves, and only a few dry, and unnoticeable scales
occur occasionally on the stalk.</p>

<p>The flowers are of two kinds, the upper sterile ones have long,
small, 4-notched tubes, and are dull purplish and yellowish-brown in
color; the lower seed-bearing flowers appear always as small buds.
They are set on short foot-stems, and are irregularly scattered along
the branches.</p>

<p>This is a parasite, drawing its life from the root of the beech;
where it looks like a dry or dead twig sticking up from the ground. It
emits a most unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>Found in dry grounds, waysides and fields, in July and August.</p>

<p>The large stalk, from 4 to 6 feet in height, is 4-angled and grooved
down the sides; it is stout, roughish, and green.</p>

<p>The short-stemmed leaf is long, narrow, and tapering, with a
sharply toothed margin, a strongly curved midrib, and a coarse texture,
with a roughish surface; in color dark green. The lower leaves are
more or less 3-cleft. The arrangement is opposite.</p>

<p>The small tubular corolla is 5-parted, and colored a rich dark blue-purple;
the green of the calyx is also tinged with purple. The flowers
grow in slender spires, which are grouped in an open pyramidal cluster
on the top of the stalk.</p>

<p>The flowers at the foot of the cluster open first, only a few at a
time; as the flowering continues upward there is left behind an ever-lengthening
line of purple tinged calices which add greatly to the
beauty of the bloom, and supply the unifying color in the general
scheme of purple and green. Seen in masses, illumined by the sunlight,
the color is rarely dark and rich. The bumble bee is a devoted friend
to the Vervain, and may often be seen in the early evening, sleepily
clinging to the flowery spire he has chosen for his night’s lodging.</p>

<p>The oval leaf tapers to the tip, is coarsely toothed, and loose-fibred;
its surface is hairy, and its color dark green. The leaves, on short

<p>The small, inconspicuous, white flower is 5-pointed. They are clustered
in long slender spires, from the top of the stalk, and the angles
of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>The leafage of the White Vervain bears a resemblance to the noxious
Nettle, that at first sight would lead us to condemn the plant as
unworthy; a closer observation bestowed upon the graceful gesture of
its flowering spires will rescue its name from the limbo of “weeds.”</p>

<p>Found in light woods in July.</p>

<p>The large stout stalk bears slender branches, grows from 3 to 4 feet
in height, and is square, hollow, and woody-fibred; it is smooth, or
covered sparsely with small hairs, and grooved at the joints. Green,
dashed with bronze, the branches sometimes purplish.</p>

<p>The lower leaves are large, broadly oval, and tapering to a sharp
point, and sit on long trough-like stems; the upper are small and narrow.
They have irregularly toothed margins, are thin in texture, and
hairy; green in color. They are set on the stalk in pairs with a noticeable
joint, the pairs occurring at right angles, and at a considerable distance
apart.</p>

<p>The very small corolla is 2-lipped; the lower lip is 3-parted, the
upper and smaller being 2-parted, and their color is light crimson with
a violet tint; the long, dull green calyx is 2-divided, the upper division
being longer, with 3 curving crimson tips. The flowers are arranged in
pairs, at right angles to each other, in slender spikes, whose long stems
bear one or two pairs of little leaves midway their length.</p>

<p>The blackish seed-pod is the oddest feature of this plant; it is

color is green, often sprinkled with lighter, mouldy-looking patches.
The leaves, on curved stems, grow in pairs.</p>

<p>The flower is 2-lipped; the upper lip slightly parted, the lower
being more broad and spreading, and 3-cleft,—the middle lobe notched.
The color varies from light to darker blue-violet, the lower lip and throat

angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>Introduced from England into our gardens, the one desire of this

<p>Found in July (but occasionally later in the season also), in the
shade of moist woods, frequently near water.</p>

<p>The stalk grows from 1 to 2 feet high, and is noticeably square; it
is juicy, hairy and rough to the touch. In color, light green, with a red
ring at the joints.</p>

<p>The leaf is oval, broad at the base, and tapering to a long, sharp
point, many ribbed, with its margin coarsely notched, and rough with
hairs; green in color. The leaves, on short, hairy, red stems, grow in
pairs, which are at alternate angles with each other.</p>

<p>The conspicuous flower is tubular, very small at the base, spreading
wide in the throat, and 2-lipped; the upper lip is very narrow, sharp-pointed,
and curving, the lower lip is larger, spreading, and often <span class="cor" title="Source: 2, cleft" id="cor496">2-cleft</span>;
the texture is fine and delicate. The pistil and 2 long, slender
stamens protrude from under the tip of the upper lip, and, like the
corolla, are colored a full, glowing red. The small calyx, with its round,
narrow-throated, and 5-pointed tube, is of a papery texture, and finely
grooved; in color it is a duller and darker red than the corolla. The
flowers are set in a large terminal head, that is surrounded by a row of
drooping, oval, smooth, red leaf-like bracts.</p>

<p>These bracts, while bright in color, do not possess the rich fullness
of hue which belongs to the flowers themselves; just beneath them a
pair of stalk-leaves crowd up close, and are each adorned with a dash
of scarlet, as though the dye had spilled over from the blossoms. The
buds open in the center of the head first, and continue blooming in
rings, outward. Not even the Cardinal Flower produces a more vivid
effect than a group of these brilliant flowers, standing beside a pool of
dark water, in the heavy shade of forest trees.</p>

<p>The smooth square stalk is slightly grooved, and somewhat slender,
though strong in fibre; it grows from 2 to 5 feet in height, and branches
only for the flowers. Color, green tinged with dull violet.</p>

<p>The leaf is oval, broad at the base, and tapering to the point; its
margin is sparingly notched, the texture is exceedingly fine, and the
surface is soft to the touch. It is aromatic in odor. The color is
grayish-green, the midrib being lighter.</p>

<p>The flower is 2-lipped, with a long slender tube, and the pistil and
2 stamens project beyond the upper lip; they are colored like the
corolla, a clear fine lavender. The small, tubular calyx is minutely 5-pointed;
of a green color that is tinted with dull violet. The flowers
grow in large terminal heads, which are set about by a row of small,
light green leaves (bracts).</p>

<p>The flowering begins at the center of the head, and continues in
ever-widening whorls, leaving behind them a slightly rounded disc of
small tubular calices, resembling a honeycomb,—the intermingled green
and lavender in this disc form a pleasing note in the color-scheme of

light green, inclining to a blue-green,—reddish near the foot.</p>

<p>The long and narrow leaf has a blunt-pointed tip, an entire margin,
and shows only its midrib; the texture is thick and a little stiff, and
the surface is very slightly rough. In color it is a fine gray-green, with
a hint of the rich color of the flower. The leaves grow upon the stem
in clustered pairs, which occur at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The small tubular flower is 2-lipped; the narrow upper lip being
2-cleft, while the wider lower lip is 8-cleft, with its middle and largest
lobe cut into 2 scallops. In texture the corolla is fine and thin, and in
color it is a deep and strong purple-blue. The 4 stamens, and the pistil,
are long, and curve out from the hollow of the upper lip,—they are
bright blue, and their tips, at first a rich red, become white as they
mature. The small 5-pointed calyx is reddish, with a fine green bloom.
The flowers grow in close groups of 3 or 5, in the angles of the leaves,
and form an irregular one-sided terminal spike.</p>

<p>This plant affords a perfect example of color-harmony, with its
contrasting absolute purplish-blue corolla, and deep red stamens,
brought into unity by the purple-toned green of its leaves. It has
a strong and pungent scent.</p>

its two opposite sides, tough-fibred, and smooth. In color, light green.</p>

<p>The leaf is long, oval with a tapering tip, a sparsely notched, or
entire margin, and a smooth surface. Its growth, on short stems, is in
pairs. Green in color.</p>

<p>The flower is irregularly 2-lipped, the upper lip hoodlike, and the
lower 3-lobed, the middle lobe being largest and fringed on its edge.
The color is violet, the hooded lip is generally darker than the other
parts of the corolla; the buds are much deeper in color than the
blossoms. The lower division of the 2-parted calyx has 2 long points;
a broad heart-shaped bract supports its base; in color it is green with a
violet tinge. The flowers grow in an elongated, or thimble-shaped head,
on the end of the stalk, and from the angles of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>The clear violet of the corolla is brought into harmony with the
leaf-green, through the violet tinted calyx which supplies the unifying
color. The plant’s habit of growth is sprangling, for the stem, which
seems strong-fibred in itself, is given to lopping weakly upon surrounding
vegetation.</p>

the upper leaves.</p>

<p>The scent of this plant resembles Pennyroyal, though less strong.</p>

<p>Found in old orchards and in upland pastures, by runnels, or wet
hollows, during August.</p>

<p>The stalk (from 1 to 2 feet in height) bears branches in pairs; it
is square, firm-fibred, and smooth. The color is green, with a purple
tone.</p>

<p>The oval leaf, with its tapering, long tip, has a notched margin, is
much veined, and is coarse in texture, while its surface is a trifle glossy.
It has a strong aromatic flavor to the taste. In color it is green, showing
the same red-purple of the stems at the ribs and margins. The
leaves are set in pairs that spring at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The very small tubular corolla is 4-divided, and dark lavender in
color; the 5-parted calyx is green. The flowers are set in whorls about
the stalk, with a space between each whorl,—beneath each ring of
flowers, and supporting it in its place, are seen a pair of little purple-tinted
bracts.</p>

<p>According to personal observation, the buds become dark purple
in color on the south side of the stalk before those on the north side
have lost their green. This is one of the nattiest of the Mints in
growth, and is held in especial affection by children.</p>

<p>Found along meadow runlets and brooks,—near clear water,—in
August.</p>

<p>The branching, leafy stalk, from 12 to 15 inches high, is square,
woody-fibred, smooth, and shining. It is a noticeably dark purple-tinted
green, sometimes reddish.</p>

<p>The leaf is oval with a broad base and sharp tip, the margin is
toothed, its ribs are noticeable, and texture thin, the under surface
being slightly rough, although the upper is velvety; its color is green,
toned with purple, which shows upon the upper side of the midrib and
along the edge. The leaves are set on short purplish stems, and
arranged in pairs, which grow at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The very minute flower has a 2-lipped tubular corolla, the upper
and lower lips being cleft, or faintly notched, in the middle; it is lavender,
and so is the pale projecting pistil. The calyx is 5-parted, very
slightly hairy, and green-purple in color. The flowers are arranged in
compact whorls, and form a close, short, round, terminal spike.</p>

<p>Its pungent odor and taste are the most commonly noted traits of
this Mint, but the rich-toned shining stalk is more worth observation.</p>

<p>The sometimes branching stalk is slender, but strong in fibre; it
grows from 5 to 10 inches high, and is hairy to the touch. Green
in color.</p>

<p>The small leaf is long-pointed, with a slightly toothed margin, and
somewhat roughened surface. It is medium green in color. The leaves,
on slight stems, are set in pairs, which occur closely, and at right angles
to each other.</p>

<p>The corolla of the very small flower consists of a downy 2-lipped
tube, the upper lip being largest, flat, and notched at the tip, the lower
3-cleft; it is lavender in color. The small calyx is 5-parted. The
flowers are set, on tiny stems, in rings about the stalk in the angles of
the leaves, forming a terminal spine.</p>

<p>The perfume of the Pennyroyal is carried to a considerable distance,—were
it not for this aromatic pungency the casual observer would
often fail to find its haunt, so closely does it keep itself among the
grasses of the pasture.</p>

4-angled, and swollen beneath the joints; coarse in fibre, and thickly
covered by stout bristle-like hairs. In color dark green, or dull
purplish-red at the joints.</p>

<p>The long-pointed oval leaf is many ribbed, with a coarsely notched
margin, thin but coarse texture, and roughened by hairs. Its color is
dull green, lighter underneath. The leaves, on their hairy reddish
stems, grow in pairs which spring at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>The small tubular corolla spreads into 2 divisions, the upper being
erect and arched, the lower 3-cleft with a slightly heart-shaped middle
lobe; its color is pink or lavender. The 4 stamens stand erect under
the upper lip. The hairy, green calyx is bell-shaped, with 5 bristling
points. The flowers are set (supported by tiny hairy bracts) in whorls,
in the angles of the upper leaves.</p>

<p>A large variety, <i lang="la">G. grandiflora</i>, is often found in the same localities;
the difference lies in the larger size of the corolla, which is clear white
in color prettily marked with purple on its lower lip, and in the rounder
shape of the calyx. Both plants are unpleasant to the touch because of
their harsh bristle-like hairs.</p>

<p>Found on dry sandy plains and in open fields, in September.</p>

<p>The branching, leafy, and erect stalk grows from 6 to 12 inches
high; it is strong and woody-fibred, not noticeably square as is usual
among the Mints, minutely hairy, and soft to the touch. Its color
is green, reddish near the root.</p>

<p>The leaf is oval, with an entire margin, and is nearly smooth to the
touch. It is green in color. The leaves, on short stems, grow in pairs.
They are strong scented.</p>

<p>The corolla is irregular in shape; 5-lobed, 4 of which are equal in
size, slightly pointed, and erect or bent slightly forward, while the
remaining lobe is long, narrow, and down-curving; in color a deep
violet-blue. The 4 stamens and the pistil are long, pale, or reddish-violet;
the green calyx is 5-parted. The flowers are set on short stems
from the ends of the branches.</p>

<p>The blossom opens in the early morning sunlight. At first the
pistil and stamens extend beyond the flower in a long curve, but as
the day advances their tips gradually draw inwards until they are
brought into the throat of the corolla, and thus become the little blue
curl which gives the plant its bye-name; by three o’clock of the afternoon
the curl is completed and the flower falls. Its odor is strong,
with a rank resemblance to the Pennyroyal.</p>

<p>A plant, from 5 to 9 feet high, with many branches and leaves;
the stalk is stout, and large (from 1 to 2, or more, inches in diameter),
and round; it is hard-fibred and smooth; in color a dull crimson.</p>

crimson; the seed-box in the center is green. The flowers, on short,
pale crimson foot-stems, grow in elongated terminal clusters upon
crimson stems.</p>

<p>The blossoms begin to open at the base of the cluster and continue
upward, leaving behind the partly formed berries; when ripe they form
a cluster of blue-black fruit, smooth-skinned, and with an abundant
crimson juice. The Pokeberry is a plant of homely gesture and a rather
strong odor, redeemed by its luxuriant growth, and the fine quality of
its foliage. The berries are favorites of children who squeeze them to
use their deep magenta-crimson juice for writing and painting and
dyeing purposes.</p>

the flower, and the leaf-stems which are from 4 to 8 inches in length.</p>

<p>The large wide leaf is heart-shaped or rounded, with an entire

the color is a strong green, whitish beneath. The stem is stout, erect,
and slightly woolly. Two or three leaves only are borne on the
summit of the stalk.</p>

<p>The flower has no petals; the calyx is shaped like a deep, round
cup, 3-parted at the top, with curling margins. It is coarse and firm in
texture, with a hairy surface; the outside dull purplish, the divisions
reddish-brown or bronze, and the inside of the cup creamy white

<p>A branching, slender shrub from 4 to 12 feet in height, of a woody
fibre which is rather easily broken. The bark is smooth and firm,
slightly glossy, and gray-brown, inclining to reddish when young.</p>

<p>The leaf is broad oval in shape, with a sharp tip, and set on a short

petal-like parts, and many fine yellow stamens, with bright orange tips.
They are set on little foot-stems, in small clusters within the protecting
grasp of two pairs of small temporary envelopes, the outer pair golden
brown and bark-like, the inner resembling the flower. These little
clusters occur close together all along the branches.</p>

<p>Found in light moist woodlands in April.</p>

<p>A shrub, from 2 to 4, or 5, feet in height, branching in an angular
fashion; the smooth close bark is very flexible and tough, gray-brown,
and slightly shining, dotted with lighter color.</p>

<p>The oval leaf is entire, strong-fibred, and smooth, and set on a very
short stem. The arrangement is generally alternate, and the color a
full green.</p>

<p>The small tubular flower, with slightly notched edges, and a thin
texture, is of a beautiful golden yellow color; the 8 orange-tipped
stamens and the pistil hang from the mouth of the tube. The flowers
droop in small clusters from the hold of three or four bracts which are
beautifully smooth and green on the inside, and thickly covered with a
fine purplish down on the outside; they are set irregularly along the
branches.</p>

<p>It is stated in Gray’s <cite>Manual</cite> there are as many temporary bracts
as there are flowers, but no hard and fast rule is observed in nature in
such details; according to personal observation 4 is the usual number.
These bracts fall as soon as the leaves push forth. It is noted that the
flowers lose their color as the leaf-buds swell, although they do not
wither until the leaves are unrolling. The bark is so elastic and tough
that a knot may be tied, without its breaking, in a stem as big as the
little finger. The first glimpse of this gray bush strung with its golden
jewels and never a trace of green about its branches, gives a pleasure
akin to the more spiritual delight of beholding the Wych Hazel which
occupies the same place in nature at the other end of the flower year.</p>

<p>Found in April, on dry uplands and along copse borders.</p>

<p>A tough-fibred bush, from 1 to 2 feet high, with many low
branches, very leafy, the bark rough, and reddish, or when old covered
by a gray bloom.</p>

<p>The long narrow leaf is cut to the midrib into many narrow and
irregular lobes, with an entire or slightly notched margin, and a thin
texture; the surface is smooth above, and rough underneath; the color
a cool strong green. The leaves are set on short foot-stems, placed
irregularly and close together. They come following after the flower
catkins.</p>

<p>The pistil-bearing flowers gathered in an inconspicuous crimson
cluster, like a scrubby little paint brush, and the stamen-bearing flowers,
borne in the form of a slender green and brown catkin, are often found
on the same plant; they grow close to the ends of the stalk in small
groups.</p>

<p>After the blossom season is over, the plant puts forth its thick
foliage, and so flavors the air from earliest spring till near midwinter,
with the sweet aroma which belongs to both leaf and flower. Though
not evergreen, the dried leaves often cling to the bushes until the new
growth displaces them. This is a genuine New England colonist of our
sterile pasture hills, growing in large clumps and groups with hardy
persistence.</p>

<p>Found in May, in deep wet woods.</p>

<p>The large, single, flower-stalk reaches about 6 inches in height, and
springs from between a pair of root-leaves; it is smooth and elastic.
Pale green in color.</p>

<p>The root-leaves are long (sometimes about 6 inches), broadly oval,
blunt at the tip, tapering into a grooved foot; the margin is entire (as
is true of all Orchids), the texture thick, and leathery. The upper side
of the leaf is dull green, underside it is silvery with bloom. The leaves
which occur along the flower-spike are long-pointed, erect, clasping, and
alternate.</p>

<p>The lip of the flower is large, and spreading, with a flattened spur
which is largest at the tip, and as long as the foot-stem; other petals
small, club-shaped, and bent over like a hood; the calyx parts stand
erect, their tips pointed. All parts of the flower are leathery, and
thick in texture; and colored a pale pink-violet, except the lip, which
is waxen white, tinted with yellow. It is set on a short, twisted foot-stem,
in the clasp of a leaf-like bract. The arrangement is alternate, in
a few-flowered spike.</p>

<p>This is a noticeably lustreless flower. The twist in the foot-stem
is an interesting feature.</p>

<p>Found in the woods, frequently under evergreens, though sometimes
in deciduous shade, during May.</p>

<p>The slender flower-stem, from 8 to 12 inches in height, is bent like
a shepherd’s crook, and bears on the curve a small, pointed, green leaf.
It is hairy, and light green.</p>

<p>There are 2 root-leaves, large (from 5 to 7 inches long), oval, with
a pointed tip, and a much clasping base; the ribs are parallel, and
prominent, the margin is entire, the texture is loose, and somewhat
coarse, and the surface is hairy. Color, green.</p>

<p>The lip of the flower is shaped like a large, hollow bag, slightly
puckered on its infolded margin; the other petals are long, narrow, and
twist, or curl, on either side of the bag; the calyx-parts are apparently
only 2 (though botanists consider the lower is composed of two parts
grown together),—they are placed above, and below the bag. The
petal-like pistil is pink; the bag—of a loose texture—is a crude
crimson-pink, inclining to violet, veined by many darker lines; the
other parts of the flower—of a thin texture and hairy—are colored a
dull reddish-brown, tinted with purple. The single flower hangs from
the end of the stem.</p>

<p>In some localities pure white forms are frequently found, and
sometimes a single stem will bear two blossoms placed back to back.
A rank odor is observable, if the plant is rudely handled.</p>

<p>Found in May, about a week later than the Pink Lady’s Slipper,
among low growths in moist shade.</p>

<p>The single stalk grows from 1 to 2 feet; it is erect, or slightly
bent aside, leafy, strong-fibred, and roughened by minute hairs. Color,
green.</p>

<p>The leaf is a broad oval, with a sharp tip, many parallel ribs, of a
loose-fibred texture, and hairy on the upper surface. Color, strong
green. It clasps the stalk, and folds about it. Two or three or more
leaves are placed alternately along the stalk; they diminish gradually
in size.</p>

<p>The Yellow Lady’s Slipper’s rounded pouch, or bag, has a circular
opening at the top, and is thick in texture, with a smooth and shining
surface. The long and narrow side petals are much twisted, and
curled; the two calyx-parts are broad-oval, the lower 2-cleft; they are
ribbed, with slightly wavy margins. All these parts are thin and
downy, and colored dull red, or brownish, or purplish, streaked with
green; the pouch is bright yellow, streaked with dull red parallel
veins. The flower is set, with an outward swinging gesture, on the tip
of the stalk, which is enlarged just beneath the point of contact.</p>

<p>The blossom is faintly odorous.</p>

<p>Found in bogs and swamps, in July.</p>

<p>The leafy stalk, about 2 feet in height, is downy to the touch. Its
color is green.</p>

<p>The large oval leaf tapers much at the tip, and clasps the stalk at
the base; the many ribs are parallel, the margin is wavy, and the
surface is roughish. In color it is a full toned yellowish-green. The
leaves are alternate in growth.</p>

<p>The bag of this flower is large, rounded, and much inflated; it is
white and crimson-pink in color, and set about by 4 white petal-like
parts. The stamens and large pistil are white, tinged with yellow.
From 1 to 3 flowers grow on the summit of the stalk.</p>

<p>This is a curious and showy flower, much sought because of its
rarity; its leafage is full, and fine in its long lines and strong curves,
and the four flying white pennants give the blossom a cheerful and
animated expression.</p>

<p>The stalk grows between 6 and 9 inches high; it is smooth, and
slender; the color is green.</p>

<p>The leaf is oval, with a thick texture, and smooth surface. Color,
a rather light green. Only 2 leaves clasp the stalk, one about midway,
and another, much smaller, quite near the flower.</p>

<p>The 5 petals and calyx-parts are long, and narrow, and spread
apart to disclose the “bearded” lower petal (or lip); their color is a
light rose-pink, the fringed lip being darker, with a pale yellow
“beard.” The flower is poised lightly upon the summit of the stalk.</p>

<p>This is one of the prettiest of our Orchids; its fragrance is fresher,
and less heavy than that of many of its stouter relatives.</p>

<p>The smooth, green, flower-stem rises directly from the root, to the
height of about a foot.</p>

<p>One grass-like, green leaf grows from the root.</p>

<p>The lower petal of the blossom is wedge-shaped, with a prolonged
base, and somewhat fringy in the center,—owing to the straightness of
the foot-stem it points upward; the other petals and calyx-parts are
pointed-oval in shape; the pistil is petal-like, and curling. The color
of the flower is dark magenta, the fringes on the lip being magenta and
yellow. From 2 to 6 flowers, on very short foot-stems, grow upon the
single stem.</p>

<p>The lip is provided with a hinge, which permits it to fall, and rest
upon the curling tip of the pistil beneath.</p>

<p>Found on moist and shaded banks, or beside wayside runlets, in
June.</p>

<p>The single, erect, and leafy stalk, which grows from 15 inches to 2
feet in height, is sharp-angled, somewhat twisted, and smooth to the
touch. In color it is a cool, pleasing green.</p>

<p>The lower leaves are sometimes 6 inches long and about 2 wide,
above they are small and narrow; the shape is a long-pointed oblong,
deeply indented on the strong midrib; with an entire margin, and a
smooth shining surface. The color is a cool dark green, silvery with
bloom underneath.</p>

<p>The flower is large and beautiful. The lower petal, or lip, is
widely spreading and deeply 3-cleft with a fine fringed margin, and a
long and slender, curving spur; the other petals are sharp-pointed, their
outer margins notched; two of the calyx-parts flare like wings at either
side, while the third part is erect between the upper petals; the texture
is very fine, and delicate. The color is an exquisite pale lilac, the lip
being slightly darker, and fading to a pure waxen white at the throat;
the spur is pale pink, or nearly white. The flowers, on fine, twisted
and curved, green foot-stems, are arranged alternately, and close together,
in a large feathery spire, each foot-stem springing from the angle of a
small leaf or bract.</p>

<p>The blossoms are slightly odorous, as though no gift had been
refused to this lovely Orchid. Not least among its delightsome qualities
is the rich toned green of its leaf, contrasting with the fairy lightness
of its blossoming spire.</p>

<p>Found by roadside springs, or in low damp meadows, during July
and August.</p>

<p>The stalk is sparingly leafy, round and smooth, and varies in
height from 1 to 8 feet; light green in color.</p>

<p>The long leaf is sharp-pointed at the tip, thin but tough in texture,
and smooth; in color yellow-green, not dark. The leaves are few in
number, clasping, and near the top somewhat sheath-like; they are
placed alternately.</p>

<p>The flower is small; the lip fan-shaped, 3-cleft, and fringed; the
other petals erect and fringy; the slender spur is curving, and longer
than the foot-stem; the calyx-parts are small and rounded, one being
erect and the two others spreading at the sides. The texture is fine,
and the color is a clear light lilac, the spur being purplish-green. The
curious little foot-stem looks like a rolled leaf; it is green, or slightly
tinted pink. The flowers are placed in a terminal spire, springing from
the angles of small pale green leaves (bracts).</p>

<p>Green at first, the lilac flush overspreads the buds as they swell
before the blossoms expand. It is an odorous flower, and fortunately
not uncommon. The spur is more curving than that of the Large
Purple Fringed, and the whole plant is more slender and less perfect in
its details, yet it is sufficiently like its early sister to be taken for a
belated specimen of the <i lang="la">fimbriata</i> when first espied amongst the tall
grasses.</p>

<p>The angular, somewhat twisted, green flower-stem rises from
between two leaves, to the height of 8 or 12 inches.</p>

<p>The large and rounding leaf is 3 or 4 inches broad, and not greatly
longer; it has many parallel ribs marking it underneath, a thick and
leathery texture, and a smooth, very glossy surface. The color is a
strong dark green, the underside being covered with a pale bloom.
The two leaves are opposite each other, lying upon the ground.</p>

<p>The flower is rather noticeable in shape, for the lip is wide at the
base, with a pointed and much curving tip; the upright petals are very
sharp-pointed (like a scimetar), and their needle-like tips cross each
other; the spur is a trifle longer than the foot-stem, and very slender;
the broad upright part of the calyx behind the upper petals curves
forward over them, and nearly meets the upward curve of the lip (thus
increasing a resemblance to a pair of nippers); the side calyx-parts are
oblong, with fine tips, which turn back. In color all parts of the flower
are green, the lip tending somewhat toward yellow. The flowers are
set, on twisted foot-stems, alternately, and a certain space apart, in a
spike; they each spring from the angle of a sharp-pointed little leaf
(or bract) which is longer than the foot-stems.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of this Orchid is the peculiar
varnished appearance of the underside of the foot-leaf.</p>

<p>The round smooth stalk grows to be 8 or 12 inches high; it is
nearly white at the foot, gaining to a dull, but pale, green near the
flowers.</p>

<p>The few leaves are lance-shaped, large near the ground and
lessening to a mere sheath above, of a tough texture, and smooth
surface. They are alternately placed, and clasp the stalk with a
marked fold on the midrib. The color is a faded yellow-green.</p>

<p>The lip of the small flower is fan-shaped, with a very narrow base,
3-cleft, and spreading; the other petals are erect and fringy; the spur is
long and curved; the calyx is small, the side-parts flaring, the third
part erect behind the petals; it is colored a pale yellow-green. The
foot-stem is slightly twisted, as long as the spur, and pale. The
blossoms are placed alternately, rising from the angles of small enfolding
leaves (bracts), in a scattering terminal spike.</p>

<p>There is a monotony of hue about this plant, and a general

<p>The lower leaves are oblong, and round-pointed, the upper leaves
longer and sharp-pointed; they are folded on the midrib, and leathery
in texture; in color dark green, the underside pale, shining, and moist.
They are placed alternately, and clasp the stalk like a sheath. Three
or 4 large leaves occur at the foot; the change to the pointed shape is
very abrupt.</p>

<p>The flower is small; the lip is sharp-pointed and flaring, the other
petals smaller and narrow, their tips overlapping, under the erect calyx-part,
while the two side calyx-parts curve downwards; the spur is blunt,
short, and curved. The seed-box is very noticeable, shaped like a large
dangled bag, with a very small neck, from which the blossom spreads.
All parts of the flowers are tinted alike, a dull green. They are set
tight to the stalk each in the clasp of a small sharp-tipped pale-green
leafy bract, in a close club-shaped spike.</p>

<p>The stamens just show their brown tips under the hooded petals,
thus increasing the fantastic likeness to a little old woman which is
given to the flower by its big seed-box. Reports from Iceland and
Greenland show that this Orchid ventures far into the arctic regions.</p>

<p>Found in moist meadows and waysides during September and
October.</p>

<p>The erect stalk varies in height from 4 to 12 inches; it is round
and smooth; light green or pale in color.</p>

<p>The long slender root-leaves (one or two), which rise from the
ground, are tapering at the base, firm and thick of fibre, and smooth to
the touch; the color is yellowish-green. A few sheathing little leaves
occur along the stalk.</p>

<p>The small flower is very like <i lang="la">S. Romanzoffiana</i>, with a curving lip,
and crinkled margins; in color it is pearly white. It is enfolded in an
oval, small, green leafy bract. The flowers are oddly arranged, in a
single much twisted row, forming a spiral spike.</p>

<p>The blossoms are sweet scented.</p>

<p>Found by runlets and in moist meadows, in June.</p>

<p>The rootstock sends up several leaves ensheathing the flower-stem.</p>

<p>The leaf is sword-shaped, long, narrow, and pointed, with a narrow,
light, ribbon-like finish to its edge; the inconspicuous ribs are grass-like.
Its color is a cool, light green, with traces of dull violet near the
foot. Several leaves overlap one another at the base.</p>

<p>The flower is large, with 9 petal-like parts, growing in sets of
threes; the 3 outer parts are broad, spreading, and curving downwards
more or less,—in color violet, marked with white and yellow, and
delicately lined with dark violet; the 3 parts that alternate with these
are smaller, erect, and taper to a narrow foot at the base,—in color they
are violet; the pistil is in 8 petal-like parts, which curve back, over the
broad outer divisions, with a fine arch (under which the stamens may
be found),—-they are cleft at the tips, and in color are violet, darker at
the tips, and reddish on the arch. The texture of the flower is exceedingly
fine and delicate. It grows from the summit of the 3-angled
green seed-case, which is borne on a tall, leafy, green stem; this stem is
slightly flattened on opposite sides, and is smooth and polished of
surface.</p>

<p>The ancients, who named this flower Iris, had a true appreciation
of its rainbow-like qualities; its texture is so ethereal that it seems to
float in the grass, and to fade before our eyes like its evanescent namesake.
It however replaces one day’s bloom by another flowering, and
keeps up a prolonged succession of blossoms from day to day.</p>

its leaf, and a lily for its heart.”—Ruskin.</p>

<p>Found, during June and July, in moist meadows and pastures
amidst grasses.</p>

<p>A few leaves and the flower-stem, from 4 to 8 inches in height,
rise from the root.</p>

<p>The leaf is like a grass-blade, fine-pointed, flat, and very thin,
especially along the margins; it is slightly ridged with veins, and is
smooth. In color, a strong green with a hint of blue.</p>

<p>The 6 petal-like parts of the flower are oblong and blunt-pointed,
with an abrupt sharp tip; their texture is thin, and they spread widely.
The coloring is charming, a pale or dark blue, with purple markings,
and a central design in yellow daintily outlined in purple; the prominent
pistil is yellow at the base, and purple above, while its 3-cleft tip is
orange. Two or three flowers are closely grouped on a little foot-stem
which rises from betwixt two sheath-like leaves set on the summit of
the rigidly upright flower-stem. This stem is furnished with thin
sword-like margins.</p>

<p>Though not found in abundance generally, this is not an uncommon
plant, and occasionally a meadow may be found which every June
morning is turned to a sea of blue, like a flax field for fullness of
coloring, and every succeeding afternoon becomes green again, because
this little Iris shuts her blue eye by mid-day. But one flower blooms
on a plant at a time.</p>

<p>Found in early May on springy slopes or in moist meadow-lands.</p>

<p>Two leaves and the single flower-stem, which is about 6 or 8
inches in height, rise from the root.</p>

<p>The leaves are long and oval, tapering at the tip, with an entire
margin, of a thick and juicy texture, and a smooth surface that is cool
to the touch. The color is green with a bloom upon it, and mottled
and streaked with dull red, which appears very strongly in the midrib
and near the base of the leaf.</p>

<p>The flower is nodding and lily like in its general character; formed
of 6 long taper-pointed petal-like calyx-parts. A ridge runs down the
middle of each of the 3 inner parts. The flower is yellow; dark reddish
on the outside of the outer divisions, and spotted with minute
reddish dots on the inside of the inner divisions. The 6 stamens are
large and yellow, and the pale greenish-yellow pistil is club-shaped,
with 3 grooves. The flower-stem is round, smooth, and pale; it grows
from between the two leaves.</p>

<p>In the sun the flower opens wide, its three outer divisions rolling
back, and exhales a fragrant smell like that of new lilac shoots; the
markings on the leaves are richer in color when the plant grows
in more shaded places. It is a communistic plant, and exceeding
capricious in withholding its bloom when transplanted.</p>

<p>Found in the shade of damp woods, in May.</p>

<p>The simple stalk, varying from 6 to 12 inches in height, bears a
whorl of leaves on its summit (from which springs the flower); it is
large, round, juicy and smooth, and a deep or purplish-red color at the
foot, but light green near the top.</p>

<p>The large and handsome leaf is a diamond shape, of about equal
width and length, pointed at both ends; its ribs and veins form a stout
and important framework, the margin is entire, texture loose, and the
surface is shining underneath though not above; the color is a full
green, tinged with pink at the base. Three leaves are set in a whorl.</p>

<p>The flower also is rather large; its 3 long oval petals are thin and
close in texture, and colored a rich deep maroon-red, the underside
inclining to purple, with parallel veins marked with a darker color.
The calyx is 3-parted, the divisions shorter and more pointed than the
petals; of a green color, edged and veined with red. The petals and
calyx-parts spread alternately around the base of the prominent,
3-parted, conical, dark crimson pistil, and the 6 erect stamens, with
their pale yellow or white tips. The single flower, on a square or
round stem, springs from the whorl of leaves.</p>

<p>Though not strong in odor, its quality is rather rank. The flower-stem
usually inclines to one side. When the plant first rises from the
ground the leaves are close folded about the sharply-conical flower bud.
White or greenish flowers are sometimes found instead of deep red.</p>

<p>Found in damp woods, during May.</p>

<p>The slender stalk forks at the top into 2 (or sometimes more)
branches; it reaches the height of 10 or 15 inches, is hard and round,
grooved a little, and shining. The color is a cool light green, tinted
with purple-brown at the foot. Two or three sheath-like leaves enfold
it near the foot.</p>

<p>The oblong leaf grows together about the stalk, with an appearance
of being strung upon it; it is deeply creased upon the midrib, the
margin is entire, and its texture is firm and thin, most pleasant to the
touch. The color is a cool fine green, underneath pale with bloom.
The leaves are alternate, and occur only upon the branches.</p>

<p>The flower is shaped like a slender deep bell, whose pointed tips
slightly curve outwards but never spread wide apart; its 6 calyx-parts
are petal-like, long and narrow, each grooved down the middle; the
texture is thin and fine, and smooth on the outside, while the inner
surface is rough as though spread with fine meal of a slightly richer
hue than the pale straw-yellow bell with its faint tinge of green. The
flower hangs singly on a short, slender, terminal green stem.</p>

<p>After the fall of the flower the stems prolong themselves with a
further succession of leaves; thus the rather conspicuous seed-pod is left
hanging near the middle of the branch.</p>

<p>The stalk, from 6 to 8 inches high, is very like its cousin Bellwort,
but is more slender and bears a leaf beneath the fork of its branches;
it is also greener in hue.</p>

<p>The oval, or long-pointed, entire, leaf is smooth above, and ridgy
beneath. Of a beautiful light green color. The leaves are arranged in
pairs at the flower, and alternately; they are half-clasping, and hang

pale yellow pistil protrudes conspicuously. The color is pale straw-yellow.
The bell hangs on a slender stem that springs from beneath a

<p>Found in moist meadows, along river banks, and in wayside
thickets in June.</p>

<p>The round, smooth, tough, green stalk grows upward at first, but
soon swings over to one side with a strong curve, leaning on surrounding
plants for support, and further assisting its progress by means of
many small twining tendrils.</p>

<p>The large leaf is nearly round, and somewhat heart-shaped at the
base; it has an entire edge, and strongly marked parallel ribs; though
thin, it is tough, and has a smooth, shining surface, and a bright green
color. The leaves are alternate at short intervals, almost crowded. The
tendrils spring from the angles of the leaves.</p>

<p>The small flower has its parts in threes, with twice three stamens;
it is dull light green in color. Very many flowers, some 20 to 40, on
short flower-stems, are gathered together in a round head; this head
is on the end of a stem from 4 to 6 or more inches long. The flowers
exhale a disagreeable odor which gives rise to its folk-name.</p>

<p>The fruit is a round blue-black berry; as it has not the objectionable
odor of the flower, the vine becomes more attractive in its fruiting
than in its blossoming season.</p>

<p>Found blossoming in June, in wet hollows, and along the borders
of upland streams.</p>

<p>Its simple, erect stalk, growing from 2 to 4 feet high, is very leafy;
it is round, and stout, an inch or more in diameter at the base; smooth,
and green.</p>

<p>The very large leaf, from 10 to 12 inches long, is broadly oval,
tapering at the tip, and deeply pleated on its many parallel ribs; the
surface is finely downy, especially beneath; in color a bright grass
green.</p>

<p>The flower is about three fourths of an inch across; the 6 spreading
petal-like parts are leaf-like in texture, and of a yellowish-green
color. The flowers, growing on very short foot-stems, with a narrow
leaf (or bract) to each one, are thickly set in a pyramidal cluster, on
the top of the leafy stalk.</p>

<p>The juice, particularly that of the root, is said to be a strong acrid
poison. It is a plant of splendid vigor, and curves; in early spring,
before the twiggery shows any green, it pushes up from the dark earth
a large, lush, green bud, charged to the full with the impulse of growth;
later its leafage becomes more or less mingled with that of its neighbors,
and so does not receive the recognition it deserves for its striking
qualities.</p>

6 stamens are colored a dark crimson-red, with brown tips, and the 3
divisions of the pistil are long and spreading. Three or four blossoms
on their slender stems hang beneath the upper whorl of leaves.</p>

<p>The green, spidery flower of the Medeola is curious rather than
pretty,—the charm of the plant lies in the slender stalk, with its two
whorls of fine green leaves lightly poised about it. When the dark
blue-black berry is ripe its stem takes on an upward curve, and at
about the same time a crimson-red spot appears at the base of the
leaves.</p>

<p>Found on rich banks, in partial shade, during June.</p>

<p>The single leafy stalk grows from 3 to 8 feet high; at first it
stands erect, but later the tip curves over and downward; it is tough-fibred,
smooth and fine in surface, and green.</p>

<p>The large broadly oval leaf is sometimes 6 inches long and 3
broad; it is pointed at the tip, and partly clasps the stalk at its base;
the margin is entire, the ribs parallel and deeply marked, and the
texture is fine, while the surface is smooth. In color it is a cool dark
green. The leaves occur alternately along the stalk.</p>

<p>The tubular flower is from ½ an inch to about ¾ of an inch long,
and spreads into 6 divisions. The color is pale green, the tips of the 6
stamens which first show in the opening of the flower are pale straw-color.
The flowers swing on slender stems, from the angles of the
leaves, in clusters of two or three (or sometimes singly,) forming a row
upon the curving stalk.</p>

<p>Following the flower-bells come the globular blue-black berries,
about the size of a pea; they are fully as charming as the blossoms, but
seldom remain long on the stalk, since they are fully appreciated by the
birds who devour them quickly. This is a plant of fine gesture, and
splendid curves, too large to be figured full-size upon the accompanying
plate.</p>

<p>Found in grass fields, and moist meadows, during July.</p>

<p>The single, leafy, and smooth stalk is 2 or 3, or more, feet high.
In color it is green, often inclined to take on a dull reddish-brown hue
near the flowers.</p>

<p>The leaf is long, pointed at the tip, and clasping the stalk at the
base; it is of strong fibre; in color a vigorous green. The leaves are
inclined to grow in whorls about the stalk, but are often placed irregularly
near the top.</p>

<p>The large and spreading, bell-shaped flower is formed of 6 petal-like
parts, whose tips are pointed, and curved a trifle,—3 of the parts
have prominent ribs down the middle; it is orange-yellow in color, on
the inside speckled with many small reddish-brown dots. The 6
stamens and the club-shaped pistil have dull tawny-orange or reddish-brown
tips. From 1 to 3, or more, flowers swing nodding on their
short stems from the top of the stalk.</p>

<p>When the orange bells of the Field Lily may be seen gaily nodding
here and there just above the feathers of the red-top grass in level
meadows, midsummer has come in.</p>

<p>Found in upland meadows, woods, and along copse-borders in July.</p>

<p>The stalk grows from 1 to 2 feet high; it is single, leafy, and
strong-fibred and smooth; in color a purplish-green.</p>

<p>The leaf is long, narrow, and pointed, of a firm strong texture, and
smooth surface. The color is a fall-toned green. The leaves are placed
upon the stalk, in whorls of 5 or more, with an occasional one, escaping
regularity, lodged between.</p>

<p>The 6 petal-like parts of the large flower-bell are narrowed at their
bases into little stems; 3 of the parts have pronounced midribs. The
color of this Lily is orange-red, or flame, irregularly marked on the inside
with large spots of reddish brown; the 6 stamens, and the pistil, have
reddish-brown tips. Usually a single flower, but sometimes two, on
slender stems, are erect upon the top of the stalk.</p>

<p>While the general direction of the stalk is upright the flower
sways from side to side with a free grace of movement. Sometimes a
single plant will stray into some little open clearing of a lonely wood
where its flame warms the whole space; or again its bell swings out
from the rocky slope of a mountain pasture. Near the seaboard it
grows in communities, where its color, intensified by the sea air, gives
it the folk-name of “Flame Lily.” The plant is said to be especially
indifferent to drought.</p>

<p>The height is variable, from 4 to 6 inches or more. The stalk is
stout, round, smooth, and green; it grows with sharp-angled turns below
the water.</p>

<p>The leaf is large and arrow-shaped, with a blunt tip; the margin

August.</p>

<p>The erect, simple, stalk is round, smooth, strong, and fine in fibre;
of a bright yellow-green.</p>

<p>The leaf is a long, narrow, green ribbon, pointed at the tip, and
growing thick toward the base where it sheathes the stalk; it has a
smooth surface, and exceedingly fine texture; of a beautiful grass-green
color.</p>

<p>The small flowers are of 2 kinds in densely crowded, round heads
which are threaded on a long curving flower-stem; the lower ones are
the seed-bearing heads, and develop into green burs about 1 inch in
diameter, the upper, stamen-bearing ones, are light and fluffy with many
fine thread-like stamens, of a dull white color, tipped with gray.</p>

<p>One involuntarily says of this plant, How Japanese! Our Western
neighbors have shown in their drawings that they appreciate the long
sweeping curves and original gesture found in many water plants. The
name of the genus means a fillet, and is derived from the ribbon-like
leaf.</p>

<p>Found in March or early April, in damp meadows, and moist or
swampy woodlands.</p>

<p>The leaves and hooded flower-clusters rise from the ground.</p>

<p>The large and conspicuous leaves, which do not unfold until the
flowering season is past, vary from 1 to 2 feet in length; they are oval
in shape with a blunt tip and heart-shaped base, have entire margins,
firm texture, and smooth surfaces, and resemble the garden Day-Lily
because of their many parallel ribs. In color a light clear green.</p>

<p>The unnoticeable 4-parted greenish-yellow flowers are gathered
closely on a fleshy round club (that is about an inch in diameter) and
enveloped by a protecting hood. This hood is large and sharp-pointed,
of a very thick and leathery texture, with a smooth and dull glossy
surface; it is a dull brown or mahogany color, mottled or streaked with
darker purple or red. From 1 to 3 or 4 of these hood-protected flower-heads
are crowded close together, along with the rolled up leaf, in the
hold of several dull greenish or slightly purple leaf-like parts which
serve as weather blankets wrapped about the whole plant.</p>

<p>After the flowers mature the hood shrivels and falls away, the
blankets disappear, and the pointed leaf-bud then unfolds, the leaves
pushing forth with fine springing curves. The strong odor of the
plant prevents close observation, and denies to it the praise its growth
deserves. In habit it is highly gregarious, and favorable meadows are
thickly sprinkled with these rich-hued hoods of our earliest spring
flower.</p>

<p>The oblong, narrow leaf is thick and juicy, with an entire margin,

bronzy.</p>

<p>The small, flat, indefinite flowers are inset closely upon a round
club, in a smooth, curiously patterned mosaic-work of a bright golden-yellow

becomes large and is flattened on one side beneath the flowers; it is
streaked with bronze beneath the water, but clear white above its
surface.</p>

<p>This well-named plant has many marks of the dragon upon it; its
solitary leaf spreads, particularly when unfolding, a green claw-like

<p class="small">This work presents upwards of 300 drawings of American wild flowers, and
careful descriptions of the flowers so depicted. The selection of flowers has been
made with a view to presenting the most typical individuals of each family. In every
case great care has been taken to depict the peculiar traits, the average size, and all
the details of each individual plant. The drawings are for the most part the size of
the flowers themselves, and the descriptions are so simple and direct that it is believed
that even the amateur will find no difficulty in verifying specimens with the aid of
the book.</p>
